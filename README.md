# Natural-Disaster-Analysis
For this project Team One decided to look into the most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the federally declared natural disasters that have happened in the last 10 years and creating our own point system to give weight to each disaster. The Team decided on the time frame of the last 10 years because the dataset is very large with about 21,000+ records which would take quite a while to load and display. The dataset that the Team used was found on fema.gov called Disaster Declarations Summary-v2 which is raw, unedited data from FEMAâ€™s National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). 

The FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary is a summarized dataset describing all federally declared disasters. The dataset lists all official FEMA Disasters Declarations, beginning with the first disaster declaration in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: major disaster, emergency, and fire management assistance. The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas(counties were not available before 1964 and Fire Management records are considered partial due to the historical nature of the dataset).
