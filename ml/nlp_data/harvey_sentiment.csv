0,FEMA overhauls the National Flood Insurance Program for climate change,CNBC,2 days ago,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/fema-overhauls-national-flood-insurance-program-for-climate-change.html,"['Climate change and its devastating impact are accelerating faster than ever, according to a ', 'from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Hurricanes are becoming stronger, rainfall heavier and flood risk higher. Yet, America’s National Flood Insurance Program hasn’t changed at all since its inception.', 'But it is about to.', 'Under the current program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency provides $1.3 trillion in coverage for more than 5 million policy holders in 23,500 communities nationwide. Homeowners in FEMA-designated flood zones are required to purchase flood insurance, but others do so voluntarily. Nearly one-third of NFIP policyholders are not mandated to carry it.', 'Starting on Oct. 1, the program will undergo a complete overhaul to make insurance pricing more accurately reflect each property’s unique flood risk. Finally, climate change will be factored in.', '“No question that this is the most substantive change to the program going back to 1968,” said David Maurstad, deputy associate administrator for federal insurance and mitigation and senior executive of the flood insurance program.', '“What we found out was that many folks with lower-value homes were paying more than they should, and those that had higher-value homes were paying less than they should. And we have a responsibility to make sure that we have actuarily sound, fair, and equitable rates. And so that’s what’s driving the change.”', 'Today, federal flood insurance is based on the property’s elevation and whether it has a 1% annual chance of flooding.', 'Under the new model, FEMA will also look at the home’s replacement cost; whether the risk is rainfall, river or coastal flooding; and how close the property is to the source of the potential flooding. Most important, FEMA will now factor in future catastrophic modeling from climate change, including sea level rise, drought and wildfires.', 'Right now, the owner of a $1 million Florida home and the owner of a $200,000 Montana home are paying the same rates for insurance, even though their risk levels are decidedly different. Under the new model, the Florida owner would almost certainly pay more.', 'Maurstad says rates will go up for some and down for others. The majority of homeowners, however, will see rates go up about 10%, which is the normal annual increase.', '“It’s just important that we address that inequity that the lower-value homes shouldn’t be subsidizing the higher-value homes going forward,” he said.', 'This shift will inevitably change the value of some homes. The costs incurred by any home are factored into its value, whether those costs are insurance, taxes, maintenance on an older home, or the home’s location.', '“You can think of it as revenue coming in and expenses going out,” said Matthew Eby, founder and executive director of First Street Foundation, which calculates flood risk scores for every home in America. Those scores are currently posted on some of the nation’s largest home listing sites, including Realtor.com and Redfin.', '“Depending on how much that insurance goes up is going to correlate perfectly to the value of that home for any new homebuyer who comes in and says, ‘This home looks great, but now I have to pay $6,000, $10,000,’ whatever it might be, a year in flood insurance, which is just going to take away from the value of the actual asset itself,” he said.', 'The change in the NFIP calculation is not just to bring better equality to the program but also to help sustain it. As storm damage increases, FEMA is increasingly paying billions of dollars out to homeowners who are uninsured.', 'Hurricane Harvey in Houston was a stark example. More than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and three-quarters of them had no flood insurance, as many were outside FEMA flood zones. Flood zones are updated only every five years, by congressional mandate.', 'During its reauthorization process this fall, FEMA will also put forward more proposals to make the program more fiscally stable.\xa0', '“No question we need to close the insurance gap. Not enough people in the high-risk area have the coverage they need to be able to be on the path to recovery after a flood event,” Maurstad said. “There’s just too much disaster, suffering, going on that we can minimize if we are able to have more people have the coverage they need.”', 'He said FEMA has proposed a means-tested affordability program that will help low-to-moderate- income individuals pay for the flood insurance that they need.', '“There’s no question with climate change and the changing conditions that if we do nothing, the program is not going to be sustainable.”', 'Got a confidential news tip?

1,Fix Disaster Response Now,Scientific American,2 days ago,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fix-disaster-response-now/,"['The True Haiti Earthquake Death Toll Is Much Worse than Early Official Counts', 'Masks Are a Must-Have to Go Back to School during the Delta Variant Surge', 'This Report Could Make or Break the Next 30 Years of U.S. Astronomy', 'End of Summer Sale', 'End of Summer Sale', 'Emergency management leaves out vulnerable groups and is poorly prepared for worsening climate-related disasters', 'Given record-breaking wildfires, hurricanes and other weather disasters that cost lives and billions of dollars amid a pandemic that brought death to every corner of the country, the events of 2020 stretched U.S. emergency management institutions. Local governments have been unable to cope with the disasters, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been strained. This litany of destruction has brought into stark relief problems of capacity and inequity—people of color and low-income communities have been hit disproportionately hard—that have been festering for decades in the nation’s approach to disaster preparedness. Now, with the climate crisis increasing the odds of calamities, we must stop kicking the can down the road and commit to the challenging work of revamping emergency management.', 'FEMA is supposed to be the agency that steps in when disasters overwhelm local resources, whereas cities, counties and states handle smaller events. But a FEMA National Advisory Council (NAC) report last November noted that state and local emergency management operations struggle even with routine events. Some towns and counties have only a part-time emergency manager, leaving them ill-equipped to prepare for and respond to disasters. As a result, they increasingly turn to FEMA, which ends up with fewer resources to spare when a major catastrophe does occur. When Hurricane Harvey flooded southeastern Texas in 2017 with an unprecedented 60 inches of rain, for example, almost half of the agency’s emergency workforce had already been deployed to other trouble spots. To free itself up, FEMA is now proposing to raise the damage threshold that triggers federal assistance. But that proposal simply will leave local areas more vulnerable. Congress or state legislatures need to supply sustainable funds that build and maintain local emergency management departments, along with any change in the rules for FEMA involvement.', 'To address the problem that all emergency agencies do little in advance to prepare for disasters, some funding could be earmarked for—and require—certain crucial mitigation work sometimes resisted by local political forces, such as elevating structures in flood-prone areas or instituting zoning laws to reduce wildfire risks. These efforts should incorporate the latest climate science—sea-level-rise projections, for example—so they do not quickly become obsolete. The National Institute of Building Sciences has found that for every $1 that FEMA and other federal agencies spend on mitigating the risks of floods, earthquakes and other hazards, society ultimately saves $6 in costs.', 'Any future mitigation and recovery funding must also be distributed in an equitable way. Research, including a 2019 study published in ', ', has shown that FEMA programs inadvertently entrench and exacerbate inequities because they focus on restoring private property. This approach favors higher-income, typically majority white areas with more valuable homes and infrastructure over people of color and low-income communities, which are both disproportionately affected by disaster and least able to recover from it. To remedy this disparity, FEMA, as well as state and local emergency management agencies, cannot rely solely on cost-benefit analyses to determine what projects to fund, because these weigh in favor of more expensive properties. They should also use other metrics, such as the Social Vulnerability Index, which identifies the populations with the least capacity to deal with disasters. Some local governments have begun to incorporate equity into their emergency planning. In Washington State’s King County, for example, floodplain managers have used census data to understand exactly who lives in flood-prone areas to better target resources and mitigation projects. Others should follow their lead.', 'One current FEMA program has tried to tackle inequity issues by allowing small, low-income communities to pay less in cost matching, which is a precondition of some FEMA aid. But these smaller governments may not have dedicated staff with the expertise to navigate the complex FEMA application process. In some cases, communities may not have the funds to meet even a lowered threshold for local spending. FEMA can begin to solve this by simplifying its funding requirements and instituting a single application process; both actions were recommended by the NAC report and in February by the Government Accountability Office.', 'Everyone, not just the well-to-do, should have the opportunity to build back their lives with the resources they need in the wake of disaster.', 'This article was originally published with the title ""Fix Disaster Response Now"" in Scientific American  325, 3, 8 (September 2021)', 'doi:10.1038/scientificamerican0921-8', 'Sara Reardon', 'Corbin Hiar and E&E News', 'Meghan Bartels and SPACE.com', 'Jonathan N.

But the program already has $8 billion in unspent grants that have been allocated to states, an E&E News analysis of federal records shows.', 'Some of the $8 billion was approved for states two decades ago.', 'The backlog comes as Congress is looking to give states a separate block of funding — also amounting to $3.5 billion — for projects that minimize damage from flooding. The money, included in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill approved by the Senate, would be allocated over the next five years through the federal Flood Mitigation Assistance program.', 'But the $3.5 billion is twice as much money as states have requested through the flood program over the past five years, federal records show.', '“It’s a great headline, but my concern is that it gives a bit of false hope that we’re flooded with mitigation money,” said Amelia Muccio, director of mitigation at Hagerty Consulting Inc.', 'The surge of federal funds could cause longer delays in states that are trying to spend billions of dollars they received years ago from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs both of the grant programs targeted for extra cash, according to some experts. ', '“If FEMA and states and subapplicants now pivot to submit new subapplications, what’s going to happen to these previous projects?” Muccio said. “It strains the limited resources.”', 'Muccio wrote in a recent ', ' that the new funding, “while incredibly helpful and needed, will tack on billions more in funding to an already backlogged system.”', 'The new funding also is raising concerns about equity as the Biden administration seeks to target disadvantaged communities in the federal effort to address climate change.', 'Less-affluent states and communities have struggled to spend FEMA mitigation grants because they cover only 75% of the cost of projects, said Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA during the Obama administration. The remaining 25% must come from states or localities — a cost-share that some jurisdictions cannot afford.', '“If FEMA is not doing anything any differently, they’re going to run into the same problems as they have in the past,” Fugate said in an interview. “Maybe this will spur state legislatures to look at ways to spend the money because of the size of the funds.”', 'Natalie Snider, senior director of coastal resilience at the Environmental Defense Fund, said, “There is a huge concern that the cost-share requirements are going to perpetuate and widen this flood-risk gap.”', 'FEMA has not changed any of its rules for spending the billions announced by Biden.', 'In a statement to E&E News, FEMA said states can account for their 25% share using in-kind contributions such as volunteer hours or disaster funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.', '“FEMA encourages communities to consider all allowable alternatives to meet grant cost-share requirements,” the agency wrote in an email.', 'FEMA also said that it is trying to “reduce the complexity” of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and work with states on spending plans.', 'The hazard program has been particularly difficult for states because the allocations are often more than they can spend.', 'States receive a hazard-mitigation allocation every time the White House declares a state a federal disaster. The allocation is supplemental to the disaster relief money that FEMA gives states for immediate repairs and is aimed at making long-term improvements that prevent future damage. The allocation is typically equal to 15% of the FEMA disaster-relief funds.', 'But the hazard mitigation allocations can be so large that states take years or decades to spend them and often return unspent money to FEMA.', 'After Superstorm Sandy ravaged the Northeast in 2012, New York state received $1.4 billion in hazard mitigation funding — one of the largest single allocations in the grant program’s 32-year history. More than $390 million remains unspent, FEMA records show.', 'New York will receive another $378 million in hazard mitigation funding under Biden’s recent allocation.', 'Puerto Rico has spent only 4% of the $3 billion hazard mitigation allocation it received after Hurricane Maria in 2017.

It’s also unrelated to his recent announcement that he would allocate $1 billion this year through a new FEMA program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities that helps pay for state and local mitigation projects.', 'Rather, the money approved by Biden through executive action has its origins in a decision President Trump made in March 2020 to give states, territories and tribes FEMA disaster aid to reimburse some costs related to the coronavirus pandemic such as overtime for public safety workers. Trump’s decision was unusual — but welcome by governors — because FEMA disaster aid typically has helped states recover from natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and flooding, not from pandemics.', 'Even as Trump approved every governor’s request for coronavirus-related disaster aid, he made no decision on the governors’ simultaneous requests for supplemental FEMA funding for hazard mitigation.

This year’s theme incorporated the “LU Stronger Together” campaign.\xa0', 'Taylor began by thanking the LU community for their hospitality and encouraged those who have yet to meet him to introduce themselves whenever they see him.', 'Taylor said he is impressed with the endurance of the campus through natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.', '“Without question, everyone at Lamar University has given new meaning to the word perseverance,” he said, citing challenges from Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda to Hurricanes Laura and Delta last year, along with the pandemic.\xa0', '“What you faced together in such a short period of time has forced you to innovate quickly and strategically,” he said. “It has also required you to tap into enormous stores of empathy and patience. As a result, the university is very well positioned to take advantage of opportunities we might not have imagined, even a few months ago.”\xa0', 'Lamar fared well in the last legislative session, resulting in funding increases, Taylor said.', '“I think the biggest news is that we were able to secure equity funding of $8.5 million annually,” he said. “Lamar University was the only institution in the state of Texas to receive an equity adjustment of this sort, correcting a long-standing statewide structural appropriations imbalance and bringing our budget for general operations more in line with our peer institutions. Lamar University also secured an additional annual increase of $5.1 million, based on Texas formula funding.”', 'The formula funding was the result of increase in student credit hour production generated by the online master’s degree programs LU offers.

These raises are possible due to the work all you have done to grow enrollment in our online master's degree programs, which in turn have led to an increase in funding and our funding formula. Online programs will continue to be an important strategic area for us to develop.”"", 'The funding increase will stop the university’s reliance on cash reserves for operations.', '“For a significant period of time, Lamar University has used cash reserves to meet the operating expenses of the University,” Taylor said. “National higher education benchmarks recommend that institutions have cash on hand to cover five months of expenses, and each of the Texas State University institutions do, except for Lamar University. Our university finished the year with cash reserves for approximately one month.\xa0', ""“Equity funding will now allow Lamar University to stop using cash reserves and funds from our auxiliary services that should have been going to maintenance to cover our annual operating expenses. Over time, we'll be able to restore our reserves to healthy levels, undertake many deferred maintenance projects, continue to modernize our facilities and strategically invest in physical plant infrastructure."", '“Our state funding increase will also provide for a budget to support emergency situations. Lamar University has been hit by numerous hurricanes over the past several years. We know this will happen again and we will need to be financially prepared. Insurance and FEMA reimbursements are sometimes available, but these funds take years to obtain and do not always cover all the costs. “', 'Taylor announced the creation of a Strategic Investment Fund to develop new programs and aid the growth of the University.', ""“In order for the university to become more competitive in the state, and at the national level, we need the cash flexibility to selectively invest in new degree programs for which there's a growing market,” he said. “I have experience in this area and find it to be a winning strategy for academic growth. Some academic programs have enormous startup costs, but within just a few years, to bring in tuition revenues that far exceed instructional and other expenses, making reimbursements to the strategic investment fund from the net revenues. These newer programs will allow us to replenish the fund and invest in the next targeted area of growth. This is just one possibility for a strategic investment fund from our university.”"", 'Part of Taylor’s strategy as president will be to not only grow the number of new students, but also to focus on existing students and their success.\xa0', '“I believe additional students will choose Lamar University, as we market current and develop new and innovative programs,” he said. “We must also focus on the success of our students who are already in classrooms as they continue their enrollment, and it will be key to our future fiscal outcomes.”', 'Taylor said that his number one priority is to grow the campus culture.', '“If we create a campus culture where we truly value each other, communicate with each other to better understand our roles in the organization, and we support and value the work each of us is doing, I promise you that amazing things are going to happen,” he said.', 'Taylor said his second priority is to foster an open environment where individuals feel comfortable asking questions about what they are doing and why they are doing it. He wants the LU community to feel comfortable asking questions, even the hard questions, he said.', 'Taylor wrapped up convocation by letting the LU community know he is dedicated to increasing both residential enrollment and retention and improving the campus culture to make Lamar University and the community that embodies it no longer “a well-kept secret.”', '\xa0', 'Contact: ']",12.2088

While the tax rate\nis down from .4312 cents per $100 of property values last year, the FY 2022\nrevenue collected will be higher than FY 2021 due to growth in the county as\nadditional properties were added on the tax rolls and the number of taxable\nparcels increased. ', 'The Proposed Budget is published in summary format with only\nfour categories for each department: salaries, employee benefits, operations,\nand capital expenses. Previous budgets have included line items for each\nspecific expense category, such as supplies, travel, continuing education,\ndues, etc. This year’s summary format lacks transparency and allows the Budget\nOffice and the department heads to operate under a fluid budget where the\nindividual expenses can change as long as the total for each department remains\nthe same. ', 'A fluid budget also allows department heads to spend the\nentire budget for their department by shifting excess salary funds to\noperational expenses and vice versa. Since the Commissioners Court directed\ndepartment heads to limit their requests during the budget workshops so\nemployees could receive a 5% raise, the department heads will need the\nflexibility of a fluid budget to correct the budget process with “budget\nneutral” changes in future months.  ', 'During the budget workshop, the Court was unclear about how\nto apply the 5% increase to employees who already received raises in July 2021.\nThen, County Judge Keough refused the pay increase for himself but approved the\nincrease for all other Montgomery County employees. However, the FY 2022 salary\nschedule has not been posted by the Budget Office. ', 'It will be difficult for citizens to understand the\nsummarized budget format without reviewing the underlying salary schedule since\nmost of the budgeted expenses are salaries. ', 'The FY 2022 Proposed Budget contains a Contingency of only\n$53,697, representing 0.014% of the total budget. Commercial projects use 5% to\n10% contingency and even the International Monetary Fund recommends 2% to 3%\ncontingency for global projects.', 'Montgomery County’s contingency for FY 2022 is extremely low\nand increases the risk the budget will not cover future unexpected events. For\nexample, when Hurricane Harvey hit and the county was devastated, while\neligible for FEMA assistance, the county paid out-of-pocket until FEMA\nreimbursed them. In a possible future hurricane event, the county’s expenses\nwould far exceed $53,697.', 'In comparison, FY 2021 had a Contingency of $572,218 and it\nwas used in its entirety during the current fiscal year.', 'When county expenses exceed the budget, the county can\nreduce the fund balance to pay for the expenses. However, Budget Director\nAmanda Carter warned the Court on July 13, 2021 that constant transfers from\nFund Balance to cover shortfalls could also look bad on the county’s credit\nrating.', 'On August 3, 2021, County Auditor Rakesh Pandey submitted ', ' that was approved on the consent agenda\nduring the August 10, 2021 meeting. The letter indicates $8 million from fund\nbalance will “buy down” Montgomery County’s calendar year 2022 retirement plan\ncontribution to the Texas County and District Retirement System (TCDRS). ', 'In other words, the FY 2022 county budget does not include\n$8 million to fund the 2022 retirement plan.

Yet, many at-risk homes are uninsured against the costliest disaster: flooding. We show that low home equity is an important driver of low flood insurance take-up. To isolate the causal effect of home equity on flood insurance demand, we exploit price changes over the housing boom and bust. Insurance take-up follows house price dynamics closely, with a home price elasticity around 0.3. Multiple mechanism tests suggest that mortgage default acts as implicit disaster insurance. As a result, households do not fully internalize their disaster risk.', '* * *', 'Introduction', 'Since 1980, ', ' has seen more than ', ' in damages from major natural disasters, with environmental risk expected to grow over time with climate change (Dahl et al., 2018)./1', 'Large disasters cause severe financial distress for many households and lead to mortgage delinquency and default./2', 'An analysis from CoreLogic finds that the sequence of devastating hurricanes and wildfires in 2017-2018 tripled mortgage delinquency rates in affected areas (Betten et al., 2019)./3', ""Ouazad and Kahn (2019) find that major hurricanes caused a 1.6 percentage point increase in the probability of home foreclosure. However, millions of flood-prone properties in the country remain uninsured for flood damage, contributing to the mortgage system's exposure to disaster risk. Identifying the causes of this flood insurance demand gap is critical for understanding how climate change will affect households and financial markets."", 'In this paper, we provide the first empirical evidence for a novel, incentive-based cause of low flood insurance take-up: mortgage default as implicit disaster insurance. After a flood, leveraged homeowners can default and limit their losses, effectively making their home equity their deductible if uninsured. For low-equity households, mortgage default can crowd out demand for formal insurance. Through this mechanism, home equity can have a positive causal effect on flood insurance demand by raising the cost of defaulting.', 'We estimate the effect of home equity on the demand for flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The main challenge to establish such a causal relationship comes from the correlation between equity and other determinants of insurance demand, such as income and disaster risk. To overcome this issue, we use the sudden variation in home prices from the housing boom and bust in the 2000s, which drove similar changes in home equity. This housing market cycle created price variation within and across housing markets driven primarily by changing land values and independent of gradual changes in flood risk, economic fundamentals, and demographics. Therefore, this setting is ideal for isolating the effect of home equity on flood insurance demand from that of the value of the physical structure at risk and other confounding factors.', ""We find a large, positive relationship between home prices and flood insurance take-up during this period. For a measure of the housing boom, we use estimated structural breaks in each MSA's home price trend from Charles et al. (2018), most of which occurred during 2003 to 2005. Figure 1 provides a reduced-form depiction of our results in the raw data. The left panel shows that MSAs with larger housing booms saw greater increases in flood insurance take-up between 2002 and 2007, which roughly correspond to the beginning and the peak of the boom. The right panel, in contrast, shows that over the housing bust from 2007 to 2012, the MSAs with the largest initial booms had the lowest growth in flood insurance policies."", 'Our formal difference-in-differences specification exploits variation in the timing and magnitude ', '* * *', '1/ See ', '.', '2/ The ', ' estimated that about 40 percent of American adults are not able to cover an unexpected ', ' expense by cash or savings (Canilang et al., 2020).

The results shows that flood insurance take-up closely follows the dynamics of home prices, has no pretrends, and is robust to controlling for annual income, housing turnover, population, employment, recent floods, and risk-dependent trends. Using housing boom size and timing as instruments in an instrumental variable (IV) framework, we estimate a home price elasticity of flood insurance take-up around 0.3. We also run a series of robustness checks to verify that the effect reflects voluntary purchases made by households and to address concerns about the exclusion restriction for our instrument.', 'We identify two mechanisms that may drive the relationship between home equity and flood insurance demand in our results. First, homeowners with more home equity may have a higher willingness to pay for flood insurance because post-disaster mortgage defaults are more costly (henceforth the ""default incentive"" mechanism). Second, higher home equity combined with easier credit access during the housing boom may have given households greater liquidity to pay annual flood insurance premiums (henceforth the ""liquidity"" mechanism). Theoretically, we demonstrate how each mechanism can create a positive relationship between home equity and insurance take-up in a stylized model. We then empirically explore these mechanisms by testing a series of hypotheses.', 'If home equity increases flood insurance demand by improving access to liquidity, then we expect a negative relationship between insurance lapsation, or nonrenewal, and home prices. Over 20 percent of flood insurance policies lapse in their second year (Michel-Kerjan et al., 2012). Across insurance settings, lapsation has been shown to be driven by liquidity constraints./4', 'We find that the relationship between home prices and flood insurance renewal rates is flat, which does not support the liquidity mechanism.', ""On the other hand, if home equity increases flood insurance demand through the default incentive mechanism, then we would expect a larger effect of home equity in states where default costs are low. We show that the home price elasticity of flood insurance take-up is significantly higher in states with borrower-friendly judicial foreclosure laws. Another prediction by this mechanism is that insurance demand should be more responsive to home equity in areas with greater tail risk exposure, which would induce default. Using a new national database of property-level flood risk, we find that MSAs with more tail risk exposure also have significantly higher home price elasticities of flood insurance take-up. Finally, take-up during the housing bust declines the most for homes built at the peak of the boom, exactly the group with the least home equity at the market's nadir. All of these findings support the default incentive mechanism."", 'These findings suggest that leveraged households do not fully internalize their environmental risk and that part of their risk is transferred to lenders instead. Lenders, in turn, rely on mortgage securitization to reduce their disaster risk exposure (Laux et al., 2017; Ouazad and Kahn, 2019; Keenan and Bradt, 2020). The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that underwrite residential mortgage securitization do not price disaster risk or enforce mandatory flood insurance purchase outside of floodplains./5', 'As a result, the remaining risk is ultimately borne by taxpayers along with ', '* * *', '4/ For a discussion of lapsation in broader insurance contexts, see Hambel et al. (2017) or Gottlieb and Smetters (2021).', '5/ Even within floodplains, evidence is inconsistent on whether mandatory purchase requirements are well enforced (Hecker, 2002; ', ', 2015).', '* * *', 'obligations from a host of post-disaster public transfers (see Deryugina (2017) and Billings et al. (2019)). As long as neither homeowners nor lenders bear the full cost of disasters, homes in risky areas will receive an implicit subsidy, a distortion that will grow with increasing climate risk.', 'This paper provides novel insights into the relationship between environmental risk and housing finance. We are the first to estimate the causal effect of home prices on disaster insurance takeup, and our estimates show an economically important causal relationship./6', 'Given a growing literature suggesting that climate change may already be influencing home prices, our estimates will be relevant to ongoing policy discussions around how climate change will affect financial and insurance markets./7', 'We also present and test a mechanism where mortgage default serves as implicit insurance, offering a new explanation for the insurance gap to complement studies on the role of adverse selection and information frictions (Gallagher, 2014; Mulder, 2019; Wagner, 2021), affordability issues (Netusil et al., 2021), and disaster aid (Billings et al., 2019; Kousky et al., 018b). Our findings suggest that, as with macroeconomic shocks, default can insure households against climate shocks (Mitman, 2016), albeit at the social cost of reducing incentives to formally insure or invest in adaptation.', 'This paper also relates to a larger literature on the effect of home prices and equity on household finance decisions. Our theoretical framework for understanding how home prices can influence insurance demand draws on an extensive set of studies examining the effects of leverage on homeowner incentives to default (Foote et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2010; Melzer, 2017; Ganong and Noel, 2020). In our setting, natural disasters often make homes uninhabitable, removing a key barrier to ""strategic default."" Our empirical analysis builds on the literature studying the impacts of changing home prices over the housing boom and bust on consumption and investment (Charles et al., 2018, 2019; Kaplan et al., 2020b; Mian et al., 2013). These results show that real estate finance has economically significant effects on insurance demand and homeowner disaster risk management.', 'Finally, our findings extend and are consistent with research on the interactions between implicit insurance from default and demand for conventional insurance. Most relevant to this study, Mahoney (2015) finds that bankruptcy acts as implicit health insurance and a higher cost of bankruptcy induces greater insurance demand. Similarly, Finkelstein et al. (2019) find that the availability of uncompensated care to uninsured patients can explain their low willingness to pay for formal health insurance. We show that default can also act as implicit disaster insurance, affecting demand for formal flood insurance and shifting environmental risk onto governments and creditors./8', 'The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a simple theoretical framework to motivate our empirical analysis. In Section 3, we describe our data and key features of the National Flood Insurance Program and the housing boom and bust. Section 4 explains our empirical design, Section 5 describes our results, and Section 6 concludes.', '* * *', '6/ Several studies have examined how insurance take-up in the NFIP is correlated with various factors (Kriesel and Landry, 2004; Kousky, 2011; Atreya et al., 2015). Typically, the analysis involves regressions that include home values as one of the covariates but not a formal treatment of unobserved confounding variables.', '7/ See the related literature studying how climate and disaster risk are capitalized into home prices (Bernstein et al., 2019; Baldauf et al., 2020; Keys and Mulder, 2020; Murfin and Spiegel, 2020; Ortega and Taspinar, 2018) and how disasters affect housing markets (Gibson and Mullins, 2020; Kousky, 2010; Zivin et al., 2020).', '8/ See Dobkin et al. (2018) for an example of how uninsured health costs spill over onto third parties.', '* * *', 'Conclusion', 'We find a significant and positive relationship between home prices and flood insurance take-up over the housing boom and bust of the early 2000s. These price changes reflect a large increase in home equity for existing homeowners but little difference in their actual structural value at risk. After ruling out alternative explanations, such as new construction or mandatory purchase requirements imposed by the NFIP, our findings suggest that home equity plays a causal role in flood insurance demand. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is comparable to other primary factors, such as premiums and flood events, in shifting flood insurance demand.', 'We explore two potential mechanisms for this effect. First, we test whether higher home equity increased demand by improving homeowner liquidity. We find no evidence that renewal rates increased with home prices, which does not support this mechanism. By contrast, our tests suggest that home equity may have affected demand by changing the implicit insurance value of mortgage default. For leveraged households facing a large flood loss, defaulting allows them to cap their losses at the value of their home equity. Thus, an increase in home equity lowers this implicit insurance value and increases demand for flood insurance. Consistent with this mechanism, we find higher home price elasticities of flood insurance demand in states with judicial review laws, where default is less costly, and in states with higher tail risk, where implicit insurance would be more valuable.', 'These results have important implications for understanding the likely impact of climate change on housing markets. As disaster risk increases over time, more homeowners will face the choice between purchasing insurance or risking default after a flood. The significant elasticity between changes in home prices and flood insurance take-up, combined with continuing low take-up rates in the NFIP, suggests that many leveraged households will choose not to insure. This means that some of their losses will ultimately be borne by the broader housing finance system or the GSEs that securitize mortgages and the taxpayers that support them. Home price declines driven by a bursting ""climate bubble"" along the coast (Bakkensen and Barrage, 2017; Bernstein et al., 2019; Keys and Mulder, 2020) could exacerbate these dynamics by reducing insurance demand.', ""However, our findings do point to two promising policy interventions. First, expanding the mortgage purchase requirement to high-risk non-SFHAs may lead homeowners and lenders to better internalize their flood risk. The SFHA mortgage mandate exists in part for this reason, and our findings suggest that underinsurance due to misaligned incentives in leveraged markets is prominent outside the SFHA. Second, GSEs themselves could start pricing the risk of disaster-induced default into securitization. This would improve lenders' incentive to require borrowers to maintain flood insurance."", '* * *', 'References', 'Anderson, D. R. and ', ' (1986).

People often receive eligibility determinations within hours of submitting their applications.', 'FEMA’s automated data verification can be problematic for people with unconventional living conditions. If someone was informally living out of a garage or a spare bedroom — or living in a mobile home with a title that never formally transferred to their name — they’re more likely to get denied assistance. If they have a Spanish name that is sometimes Anglicized or misspelled — or they have two last names that are sometimes hyphenated, sometimes not — they’re also more likely to be denied. It could get particularly tricky if a family includes undocumented parents with a child who is a U.S. citizen.', 'If there are multiple households living on a property — like roommates sharing a home, or multiple families in different buildings with the same address — only one of them could apply for assistance.

She wouldn’t say if the agency was working on improving its disaster assistance applications to alleviate this common mistake.', '“If the agency finds that there may be something in the application process that is causing applicants to fall short or needs some [interpretation], I am very sure the agency will improve it, if that’s the particular case,” Melo said.', 'Jackson County officials say two-thirds of the homes destroyed by the Almeda Fire were manufactured homes. Like Meunier, mobile homeowners face a number of challenges in applying for disaster assistance. They need to provide months-long proof that they paid space rent, a copy of their lease agreement and a title to their home, which isn’t always available because of the generally informal process of buying a mobile home.', '“For people who are living in mobile homes, they may not have those title documents,” Saadian said. “Even if your state may require you to register it, it just doesn’t happen like that. Sometimes the park owner might have it. Sometimes it’s never delivered when the home is delivered.”', 'An air tanker flies above south Medford to drop fire retardant onto the Almeda Fire as it tore through residential neighborhoods on Sept. 8, 2020.', 'Saadian and the Low Income Housing Coalition are encouraging FEMA and Congress to enact legislation that allows mobile homeowners to self-certify homeownership in lieu of title documents, a process that had been allowed after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. FEMA only allows self-attestation in U.S. territories, not in the states.', ' ', 'Mobile home parks have historically been located in areas that are susceptible to natural disasters, including wildfires and hurricanes.', '“They’re in areas where wildfires occur and where flooding can occur because they’re tucked away,” said attorney Ilene Jacobs with the California Rural Legal Assistance. “Some of them are quite substandard and are in areas adjacent to a highway.”', 'The Almeda Fire burned through the Bear Creek Greenway, a riparian area and bike path running along the Interstate 5 freeway.

It has brought epic flooding that will affect millions of people. Rivers are still rising, the rain still falling.

This country has not been hit by a major hurricane since 2005.”', 'That was the right thing to worry about, it has turned out. Long, just two months on the job, is coordinating the federal response to Harvey — the first storm of Category 3 or higher to hit the United States in 12 years — and the system’s lethal aftermath.', 'FEMA acts as the nerve center for the entire federal government response, which now includes 5,000 federal employees in Texas, officials supplied by the Coast Guard, the Energy Department (whose staffers look for power failures and effects on oil production), the Department of Health and Human Services, and many other federal agencies.', 'FEMA said Sunday afternoon that it had 400 urban search-and-rescue personnel in Southeast Texas and that more than 500 additional rescuers would arrive Sunday evening. As of noon Sunday, the Coast Guard had 423 active-duty and auxiliary personnel and reservists deployed to the disaster zone, along with 16 helicopters flying rescue missions, Coast Guard spokesman Dave French said. The number of helicopters is slated to increase to 24 by Monday morning.', 'French said the agency has launched more than 2,000 rescue efforts and is searching for people stranded in homes and on rooftops in the Houston area. ', 'The Department of Health and Human Services has assembled a team of 650 medical professionals in Dallas, waiting for orders to deploy to communities hit by the storm. Employees flew to the area Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from California, Ohio and other states. “We can open a small emergency room,” said Edward Gabriel, HHS’s principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response.

', 'Harvey’s winds are creating a storm surge along the coast and in the bays and estuaries, essentially jacking up “sea level” and reducing drainage; gravity isn’t much help.', 'The flooding in Houston also is slowing relief efforts elsewhere in Texas, which has experienced widespread flooding. Hundreds of Red Cross staffers and volunteers flew to Houston, expecting to drive to other affected areas to the south. But as the weather deteriorated Saturday, the organization determined that it was not safe to divert its staffers, issuing a “shelter in place” order.', 'Across Texas, 35 Red Cross shelters are open, but officials say the number will increase greatly on Monday. Relief efforts also are being slowed by a lack of hotel rooms in Corpus Christi, where many businesses remain closed because of widespread power outages. Those that remain open are overwhelmed by an influx of utility workers, fire and police crews, journalists, and evacuees.', 'Although FEMA has jumped on the Texas storm, its director has emphasized in recent interviews with The Post that the initial response to a disaster — whether it’s a wildfire, a flood, a tornado or some other calamity — has to come from local and state agencies.', '“Emergency management’s a partnership. It’s all based on a community’s capacity to handle an event,” Long said. “All disasters begin and end at the local level.” As Long has described it, FEMA’s job is to arrive when the local and state agencies are overwhelmed, which is what is happening in Texas. ', 'Long has spoken of the need for a massive overhaul in how the country prepares for disasters, noting that the federal government alone can’t always save the day. Ordinary citizens need to be prepared to be first responders, Long said. They need to have personal emergency plans. They need to be able to feed themselves for several days if disaster strikes. They need to be ready to save neighbors in harm’s way.', '“People need to be the help before the help arrives,” he said this month at FEMA headquarters on what the agency referred to as a “blue-sky day” — a day without a major national catastrophe.', '“I think we have to look at how we ask citizens to be ready, first of all. We used to look at citizens as disaster victims. Now they’re looked at as what we call disaster survivors,” he said. “I think we have to focus our attention back on the citizens and how we’re training citizens to be truly ready for a disaster. Whether it’s an active shooter, whether it’s a tornado, in many cases citizens find themselves having to render first aid, CPR, or making safety decisions before the true first responders arrive.”', 'W. Craig Fugate, President Barack Obama’s FEMA director for two terms, said this month that Long’s words about shared responsibility among federal, state and local agencies are an echo of what Fugate advocated for when he ran the agency.', 'Both men said, in different language, something similar: Americans tend to get complacent about the possibility of a disaster. “We have a long way to go,” Long said about the nation’s overall disaster readiness. Fugate, now retired, was more blunt: “It sucks.”', ' ', ' ', 'Harvey made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane, then crept slowly inland. On Sunday, it was still a tropical storm, with a center of circulation 35\u2009miles west-northwest of Victoria, Tex. The system had started to backtrack slightly Sunday, moving at just 2\u2009mph to the southeast.', 'Harvey is the first major hurricane — Category 3 or higher — to hit the United States since Wilma in 2005.', 'Earlier that year, Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,800 people, most of them in Louisiana, and put much of New Orleans underwater. FEMA’s initially sluggish and ineffective response to Katrina tarnished the agency’s reputation. It became a late-night talk show joke after President George W. Bush praised Michael Brown, his FEMA director: ', ' ', 'A 2006 law that Congress passed after Katrina is credited with improving the culture of an agency that had suffered from budget cuts and a lack of professional emergency managers early in the Bush presidency. The law required FEMA to dispatch teams to the scene along with massive relief supplies before a disaster hit. ', 'Under Fugate, the agency improved coordination with the Red Cross and state and local emergency managers, and it boosted its use of social media to offer assistance to storm victims.', 'Yet even as nearly 60 federal agencies from the Defense Department to the Internal Revenue Service were on hand for the response to and recovery from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, FEMA confronted the limitations of bureaucracy in any disaster. ', 'Large areas of New York and New Jersey were without electricity for weeks, for example, as FEMA struggled to get private utility companies and state agencies to move faster to restore power. Many homeowners who applied for disaster assistance found only confusion as they tried to navigate the many federal agencies tasked with helping them.', 'Trump has proposed cuts to federal emergency response funding. FEMA’s $3.5\u2009billion budget would lose $361\u2009million under the spending plan the White House submitted to Congress in March.

FEMA also has ongoing or planned efforts that could inform fraud risk assessments. However, the agency has not comprehensively assessed fraud risks to these grants as called for by leading practices in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. Fraud risks include those from debris removal schemes—such as misrepresenting the amount, source, or type of items removed—or associated with procurement and contracting, such as bribery, collusion, and false invoicing. According to officials, FEMA manages fraud risks to PA emergency work grants through its existing grants-management and program-integrity efforts. However, absent regular fraud risk assessments, including identifying inherent fraud risks and examining the suitability of existing controls, FEMA lacks reasonable assurance that these efforts effectively address the most significant fraud risks facing PA emergency work grants."", ""FEMA provides resources to help PA applicants meet their responsibilities for managing risks, but opportunities exist for the agency to improve communication. Specifically, GAO found that FEMA communicated some information that could help applicants manage fraud risks, but key resources did not provide information on known areas of fraud risk. According to GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, a leading practice is to provide fraud-awareness training for external stakeholders—such as PA applicants—with responsibility for implementing aspects of the program. Further, a leading practice for implementing effective fraud-awareness initiatives is to convey information about risks and how to identify fraud schemes. According to FEMA officials, the agency generally does not use the term “fraud” because FEMA's focus is on ensuring compliance and eligibility. However, the deceptive nature of fraud makes it harder to detect than nonfraudulent errors, such as compliance and eligibility issues, and potentially requires control activities designed to prevent and detect criminal intent. Updating key resources for applicants to ensure these resources consistently communicate information on the highest fraud risks to emergency work grants would help ensure applicants are better able to identify and address potential fraud earlier in the process."", 'FEMA has obligated over $10 billion in PA grants for emergency work to applicants in the three states and two territories recovering from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017. FEMA faces challenges balancing the need to quickly deliver disaster funds while minimizing the risk of fraud—challenges increased by the size and scope of the 2017 disasters and the complexity of the PA grant program. Fraud schemes have included false documentation for debris removal.', ""GAO was asked to review a range of disaster response and recovery issues following the 2017 disaster season.

The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act requires FEMA to consider factors including cost-effectiveness when determining which types of housing assistance to provide. Although FEMA has stated its direct housing programs were relatively more cost-effective than DHAP, FEMA generally could not support these statements with cost data. Specifically, FEMA does not collect key program data in its system, such as monthly subsidy and administrative costs, in a manner that would allow it to analyze the full costs of providing the assistance. Without such information, the agency's program activation decisions will not be well informed, particularly with regard to cost-effectiveness. FEMA policy guidance also says that FEMA is to compare the projected costs of the direct housing programs it is considering activating, but does not consistently specify what cost information to consider, such as whether to use both programmatic and administrative costs. Without such guidance, FEMA cannot reasonably assure that its assessments and their results incorporate consistent and comparable data."", 'The 2017 and 2018 hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael) caused $325 billion in damage.

Yet more than 100 days after Harvey’s landfall, the General Land Office had provided short-term housing to fewer than 900 families.', 'And by the time the GLO contacted more than 33,000 families for the short-term housing help they sought, those Texans had made other arrangements. Many officials fear an untold number of people are living in moldy, unrepaired homes.', 'The new process was delayed from the beginning: Abbott didn’t tell Bush’s office about the plan until 19 days after the storm’s Aug. 25 landfall — and one day before the governor and FEMA officials publicly unveiled it.', 'Federal records suggest that state officials almost immediately had concerns that hiring and training the necessary personnel would require additional time.', 'The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. ', '.', '“The program probably didn’t get started as quickly as any of us would have liked, but it is new,” FEMA coordinating officer Kevin Hannes told The Texas Tribune.', 'The state-led plan was raising alarms from federal officials as well. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General said in a Sept. 29 “management alert” that because FEMA still hadn’t developed policies and procedures for the disaster recovery efforts, officials in hard-hit communities had been forced to develop housing plans themselves on a “disaster-by-disaster basis.”', '“The problem is no one really understands how FEMA works,” Rockport Mayor C.J. Wax said at a Texas Tribune event in October. “When you don’t understand how they work, then how can they understand what our needs are?”', 'Six months after Harvey caused an estimated $200 billion in damage, more than ', ' and another 2,000 households have received temporary housing, such as mobile homes and trailers.

For months after Harvey rocked Aransas County’s beachfront communities, dozens of displaced families camped here, at what’s officially known as the Rockport Relief Camp on the north end of town.', 'That number is now down to about a dozen people. But the camp remains the staging ground for donated items — from clothes and blankets to diapers and baby formula — that routinely get matched with residents who lost virtually everything they own.', ""“There are so many people in Rockport right now living in one room because that's the place where the roof doesn’t leak quite as bad,” said Sam McCrary, who owns the land on which the camp sits."", 'The 46-year-old’s catering and event business in town, the Mermaid Kitchen, was destroyed by the storm. But the house she bought just months earlier sustained little more than shingle damage. McCrary received updates about her town’s extensive damage as she sheltered in Nacogdoches and decided to turn her land into the town’s lifeline.', '“I contacted everybody I knew and said, ‘Hey, this is what I’m going to do, send me some money,’” she said this week.', 'After raising $5,000 in 24 hours, McCrary returned home three days after the hurricane came ashore with a travel trailer packed with bottled water, food, chainsaws and shovels —\xa0“Anything we could think of that we knew people were going to need immediately,” she said.', 'Within days, McCrary was serving meals to hundreds of people a day. She estimates the number of people stopping by for meals peaked at about 1,100 at one point. Before too long, people were encouraging her to run for mayor. She thought about it. Then she thought again.', '“I could accomplish more with what I’m doing here than I can at City Hall,” she said. “Out here I’m a loose cannon. I do whatever the hell I want to.”', 'When a natural disaster strikes anywhere in the United States, the three federal agencies that primarily oversee and distribute housing recovery money are the Small Business Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and FEMA.', 'The SBA provides homeowners low-interest loans of up to $240,000 to repair damaged homes and replace destroyed personal property and vehicles. That agency approved more than $1 billion worth of loans in the first two months after Harvey.', 'HUD oversees long-term recovery efforts that include replacing destroyed homes and rebuilding damaged roads and government buildings. So far, Texas is set to receive $5 billion in HUD disaster relief aid. It will also receive a still-undetermined cut of ', ' that Congress approved earlier this month, to be split between states and territories impacted by hurricanes and wildfires last year.', 'FEMA’s chief goal has traditionally been to provide short-term relief, including everything from hotel rooms and money for minor home repairs to trailers where people can live until they receive government grants or save enough to rebuild on their own.', 'Turning that job over to the Texas General Land Office required state staffers to get a crash course on FEMA procedures and regulations. Then the GLO had to negotiate contracts with a host of entities, from FEMA itself to local governments to individual contractors who would start repairing homes with minor damage.', 'It’s unclear how much the ramp-up period delayed getting Harvey victims into trailers, mobile homes or apartments — or how the number of Texans currently living in or waiting for short-term housing compares to the six-month anniversary numbers of previous storms.', 'As thousands of Texas families remain displaced, the GLO is already working on a new disaster response handbook Abbott and Bush have promised. But the history of American disaster response is littered with unheeded recommendations.', 'Some best practices that grew from previous storms — including a recommendation to have government partnerships and vendor contracts in place before a disaster strikes — have not been followed for Harvey.', '“It seems like every event there are lessons to be learned, and then we relearn them after each event,” said Brittany Eck, a spokeswoman for the GLO.', 'Local officials across the battered Coastal Bend have fiercely criticized the Harvey response plan, which they blame for months-long delays in helping their displaced residents. But their ire isn’t aimed at Abbott or the GLO. Instead, it’s virtually all focused on FEMA.', '“They may have very well set you up to fail,” Bujan, the Port Aransas mayor, told lawmakers in December.', 'In Port Aransas, Gallegos, who lives and works at the Marina Beach RV Park, can rattle off myriad hurdles she and her neighbors have faced in getting federal or charitable aid after Harvey tore through this Gulf Coast beach town.', 'Even using a maiden name instead of a married name on paperwork can gum up the process, she said.', '“It’s pretty desperate down here,” Gallegos said.\xa0', 'After being turned down for Red Cross assistance and an SBA loan, Gallegos was still waiting to hear about her FEMA application more than three months after the eye of the hurricane slammed into nearby Rockport. Gallegos said she had to justify to the agency why her mailing address was a post office box. And even after she explained, six weeks passed with no apparent progress on her application.', '“It’s repetitive, silly stuff to brush you off,” she said. “I think what they’re trying to do, which is almost the point, is to get you to just give up.”', 'Harvey shredded Gallegos’ mobile home, which her family bought after selling their house in San Antonio so they could live full time in their favorite vacation spot. Gallegos said she received just enough insurance money to pay off the outstanding debt on the destroyed home, but not enough to make a down payment on a replacement.', 'Luckily, she said, a local nonprofit named Homes for Displaced Marlins gave her family $5,000 for a new mobile home. The charity was formed after Harvey and originally aimed to raise $400,000 to buy mobile homes for 20 families. By early this month, it had raised almost $1 million and helped 48 families.', 'With her family in a new home, Gallegos’ worry turned to the rest of the town. The storm shuttered so many businesses that many of her friends no longer have jobs. Others didn’t have homes. Many had already scattered to start new lives in places from North Texas to California.', '“It’s like you’re trying to run a tourist vacation town on 10 percent, if that,” Gallegos said.', 'But even with demolition crews tearing down damaged restaurants and hotels empty except for construction workers, Gallegos said she and her family are staying.', '“You can’t just walk away from a whole town,” she said.', 'State and federal officials have said it for months: For the recovery to succeed, it’s going to have to be locally driven. But up and down the Texas coast, mayors and county commissioners from the hardest-hit areas have repeatedly complained to state lawmakers about not having access to FEMA data that would tell them how many homes in their towns were damaged and how many people have been given or denied federal assistance.', '“We don’t have a clue,” Fulton Mayor Jimmy Kendrick testified at a committee hearing in December. “We can’t tell you how many people are living here right now.”', 'Due to federal privacy law, FEMA typically won’t provide certain data to other agencies until their employees obtain a certain level of security clearance. And many small communities that bore the brunt of Harvey’s winds don’t have technology sophisticated enough to store and protect so much sensitive information — or the resources needed to quantify and track the kind of extensive damage Harvey unleashed.', '“A local little city like ourselves, you don’t have that expertise,” said Bujan, the Port Aransas mayor.', 'Meanwhile, the GLO’s agreement with FEMA prevents state employees from sharing the data that local leaders are requesting.', '“We can’t exactly share the criteria by which applicants are being declined,” Bush, the land commissioner, told lawmakers when asked why hundreds of thousands of families had been denied assistance.', 'While Bush’s agency can’t share the reasons why, it knows how many people in each community have been denied short-term aid, and that will help local leaders quantify how much money they’ll need from HUD’s long-term recovery grants, said Eck, the GLO spokeswoman.', '“So that is information that, if we were not involved in this process, we would not have,” Eck said.', 'The lack of data hasn’t been local officials’ only source of frustration. At state legislative hearings, public events and in interviews, they have portrayed the FEMA aid application process as confusing to people already living with the stress of displacement and property loss.', 'San Patricio County Judge Terry Simpson told state lawmakers in November that turnover among FEMA staffers compounds the confusion.', '“The faces keep changing, and when you get a new face, you’re going to get something different,” he said.', 'GLO staffers began recognizing slowdowns in the disaster aid process as they learned about and implemented FEMA’s short-term housing programs, Eck said. For example, one housing repair program’s damage threshold was preventing many Harvey victims from qualifying, and Eck said the the agency successfully got the threshold lowered so more people would qualify.', 'Other hurdles haven’t been as easy to overcome. Eck said helping renters has proven difficult because they don’t qualify for mobile homes (since they don’t own property on which to put them) and local landlords have resisted offering apartments to displaced people because one of the federal programs prohibits them from running background checks on applicants.', '“We found it was not a popular option,” she said.', 'Mario and Rosemary Zamorano are glad to be back in Rockport after Harvey forced them away, though they don’t want to be living in a mobile home.\xa0But after the estimate to tear down their place came in between $8,000 and $16,000 — it’s a total loss because of extensive roof and water damage — they didn’t even try to figure out the cost of actually rebuilding.', '“When you start throwing around numbers like that, it’s overwhelming,” said Rosemary Zamorano, a 36-year-old mother of five.', 'Their plan now is to have Mario Zamorano, who works in construction, tear down what he can when he’s not taking other jobs helping neighbors rebuild their own homes, then hope to save enough to rebuild.\xa0', '“He has to work,” Rosemary Zamorano said. “We still have bills. It doesn’t come easy. We have to live day to day.”', 'It could be months or years before Texans like the Zamoranos know if they qualify for long-term housing grants.\xa0', 'After months of living with relatives in Corpus Christi, they were among the first families in Texas to receive a mobile home through a short-term housing program that the General Land Office is overseeing. Shortly after, they got a visit from Melania Trump, Karen Pence and a bevy of government officials and reporters who toured the Coastal Bend’s devastation.', 'Rosemary Zamorano wasn’t excited about hosting the horde of officials, but she hoped it would bring attention to the ongoing plight of the town and their neighbors who are still waiting for assistance.', '“We’re grateful and thankful because we’re home now in a warm place, but what about all the other people who haven’t for whatever reason been able to get the help they need?” Rosemary Zamorano said.', 'When Harvey struck, she said, “People all over the world want to help, but once the stories are gone, that stops as well.”', 'Earlier this month, Rockport celebrated a major milestone: the 500th reopening of a business that closed after Harvey. That leaves about 800 establishments still closed. But business leaders are pushing to get 500 more businesses up and running before the end of the summer tourism season.\xa0', 'This season, they’re promoting Rockport as a place where visitors can enjoy the beach and help fellow Texans muck out houses and hang drywall in shuttered stores. They call it voluntourism. McCrary, who started the relief camp, is now getting her land ready to host church groups and Boy Scout troops who plan to visit the town this summer and help with the recovery.', '""If everybody did that, just think how much better the world would be,"" she said.', 'Up and down the coast, optimism is growing as more open and businesses come back in time for the tourists. Still, it could be years before life looks like it did before Harvey.\xa0', '“It’s not going to be 100 percent,” said Bujan, the Port Aransas mayor. “It can’t be. That’s just impossible.

Low 78F. Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph..', 'Partly cloudy. Low 78F. Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph.', 'Water is Carteret County’s greatest asset but paradoxically it is becoming one of the county’s greatest problems as we saw last week during three days of torrential downpours that created nuisance flooding throughout the region. As the county continues to grow because of the attraction of its water resources, storm water management is going to become a major problem needing aggressive action and planning. Any delay may result in federal mandates which will in turn become more difficult and costly as more land is developed and prices continue to rise.', 'Pine Knoll Shores, Emerald Isle and Cape Carteret are to be commended for taking the lead on these issues. Pine Knoll Shores has initiated storm water services to reduce flooding in normally flood prone areas of the town. Both Emerald Isle, which has worked previously on storm water control, and Cape Carteret, have included storm water issues in their board agendas. But all the other towns and the county need to step up with plans and mitigation action now. This issue is not confined geographically; it is a countywide problem.', 'As the rain event approached last week, the National Weather Service initially announced a flash flood warning. Fortunately, that warning was downgraded but still the rainfall, ranging from 9.55 inches to a low of 2.34 inches recorded in a 48-hour period, created significant nuisance flooding in the county. Several town managers reported road flooding with the worst occurring in the Wildwood area, just outside of Morehead City’s town limits. A trained spotter for the weather service reported that entry to one neighborhood on Highway 24 was blocked by 2 to 3 feet of water at one point.', 'The continued record setting tourism revenues reported by the county’s tourism board are an indication of the growing interest in the county from both tourists and future developers. The eventual construction of I-42, replacing highway 70, will quickly add to the county’s growth, resulting in additional impervious surfaces from buildings, parking lots and more roadways, all of which will exacerbate current storm water flooding problems in the county.', 'There is no way to stop this growth but it must be planned, otherwise additional development will overwhelm the county’s already limited capacity to handle storm water distribution. And any response in the form of land purchases to hold storm water will become expensive as property prices continue to ratchet up.', 'There is an addition stress on this subject coming from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) which is in the final stages of an update anticipated for release in September by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Entitled “Risk Rating 2.0,” the new flood plan has added storm water management as part of the criteria for establishing the cost of flood insurance premiums, which are expected to increase for all property owners.', 'The new flood plan risk rating notes that “premiums for individual properties will be tied to their actual flood risk rather than flood zone,” which includes flooding from storm water regardless of physical location. This means is that while a property may not be mapped within an identified flood zone, it still may be charged a higher premium because of the possibility of flooding from storm water caused by heavy rainfall as seen in Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX and of course Hurricanes Floyd, Matthew and Florence in North Carolina.', 'The response and planning by a municipality or local government can influence these premium charges as noted in the new Risk Rating plan. Focusing on the impact of storm water flooding, the plan recommends that local governments participate in a Community Rating System that addresses improvements to storm water management. Communities that participate in CRS can see a reduction of 5 - 45% in premium reductions.', 'This reduction will be meaningful for residents and businesses required to purchase flood insurance as a result of financial restrictions coming mostly from mortgage companies. The Risk Rating report acknowledges the potential impact of flood premiums, noting that the new ratings are “projected to lead to premium increases for a majority of NFIP policyholders which could raise questions of affordability.”', 'Funding for planning and corrective action is currently in the pipeline for local governments to use but those funds and time will not last long. And the soon to be released NFIP Risk Rating will be an added incentive for both municipal and county action in order to reduce the oncoming premium increases that the plan has already identified.', 'That quote, “could raise questions of affordability,” should get the attention of every property owner and every municipal and county board member in the county. If the county wishes to remain affordable, let alone attractive, to both current and future residents, action is needed now to address storm water control.', 'Your comment has been submitted.', 'Reported', 'There was a problem reporting this.', 'While talking about it is nice , it is action that is needed . Often such action is not pretty and is disruptive and expensive but necessary . Miles of government red tape will probably have to be breached leaving many folks with brushed egos and even some acts of defiance . Unwavering focus on the goal is required but once again politics will rear it’s ugly head . Always does . In other words , Git Er Done and worry about the blathering later . The time for just talk is long over .', 'Too late. The train has left the station. Too much has been built. Too much development. Too much wet lands filled in. Too much dirt, concrete, buildings, etc. Now you are left with pushing that boulder up the hill. It can\'t be ""mitigated"" out of at this point. Sure you can try if it makes every one feel all warm and fuzzy. Lots of money to be made too, now and forever. You can\'t take a bucket full of water, dump stuff into it and not expect the water to run over the sides. The water has to and will go some where. Simply basic science.', 'I like the analogy, slick. Well said.', '""Funding for planning and corrective action is currently in the pipeline for local governments to use but those funds and time will not last long. "" Simmer down and don\'t worry if there is money to be spent they will spend every dime. I am pretty sure it won\'t be enough money and they will need more. Will it help our ever increasing insurance rates? Of course not but that isn\'t really the important matter at hand.', 'Agree to a point , tired , but proper drainage can be installed . Some of it at the property owners direct expense and some of it paid for by the collective . The hang up appears to be at the decision making level . Not wanting to upset anyone with the next election in mind . Keep your eyes closed and hope the problem will go away .', 'Define the problem.

Today on the show, we look at the unfairness that's baked into the government's response to disasters. When a disaster like a hurricane or wildfire destroys your house, the clock starts ticking. Every day without stable shelter puts people in danger. It's harder for sick people to take their medications. Medical devices stop working. Heat and mold threaten everyone's health. The federal government is supposed to help prevent that cascade of problems."", 'HERSHER: But an NPR investigation finds that the people who need help the most are often less likely to get it. And the government knows it has a problem.', ""CHATTERJEE: You're listening to SHORT WAVE, the daily science podcast from NPR."", '(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)', ""CHATTERJEE: So, Becky, before you tell me about your visit with Donnie, help me understand the background here. What is FEMA's role after disasters like hurricanes?"", ""HERSHER: Well, it's pretty straightforward. You know, FEMA is supposed to help people with their immediate needs, and safe, stable shelter is the big one. So people who own homes can apply for money to repair damage or find a new place to live if the house was completely destroyed. And there's also money to help cover the cost of rent or a hotel room. And then sometimes FEMA brings in temporary trailers that you might have heard about, and that's emergency housing."", 'CHATTERJEE: And what do we know about who ends up getting that money?', ""HERSHER: Right, so that's the question I've been asking for years now, actually. So all the way back in 2017, I noticed that poorer people seemed to be struggling to get adequate help from FEMA. And it was anecdotal. I mostly noticed it in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. Back then, there were some studies coming out that suggested that FEMA assistance was disproportionately benefiting whiter, wealthier people."", 'CHATTERJEE: And I imagine you asked FEMA about that. And what did they say?', ""HERSHER: Yeah, I did. And basically, they said that their programs were designed to be fair; everyone can apply for help under the same criteria, so it's a level playing field. Then fast-forward a couple years, and I heard from a source of mine that FEMA had been doing some internal analysis about this exact topic. So, you know, a reporter - I asked to see them."", 'CHATTERJEE: Yeah.', 'HERSHER: And initially, FEMA denied that. NPR appealed. Months went by. But eventually, they gave these records to me. And the records showed low-income disaster survivors are less likely to receive some types of housing assistance from FEMA, and when they do receive money, they often receive less.', ""CHATTERJEE: Is this because FEMA payments are based on how big or expensive your home was? So if you're rich and have a bigger, more expensive home, you get more money."", ""HERSHER: Yeah, I think that's, like, a natural guess that a lot of people would make, and it's likely part of the story. But it appears to be more complicated than that. So researchers I talked to said that home size does not account for the disparity, and that kind of gets at what you were saying. The data suggest a few additional reasons that might be at play. So poorer people are more likely to be denied money because the damage to their home is deemed insufficient by FEMA, and usually that's because the applicant can't prove that the disaster caused the damage. So the analysis actually suggests that the disparity could have something to do with the inspection process. Like, maybe inspectors are looking at the homes of poorer people and saying, this roof already needed maintenance, so a lot of this damage can't be blamed on the hurricane, for example."", ""The other thing that might be at play is that people who can't prove that they personally own their home or that they're named on a lease, they are also cut off from assistance, so that might be accounting for some of this disparity."", ""CHATTERJEE: So what about Donnie Speight's situation? Where does her experience fit in?"", ""HERSHER: Right. So her experience is probably tied to a third reason. So basically, FEMA isn't super focused on outcomes. Like, they assess how much damage you have; they give you an amount of money that they think is fair, and that's basically the end. You know, the agency isn't checking to make sure that you were actually able to get stable housing with that money. Now, that is less of a problem if you have savings..."", 'CHATTERJEE: Right.', ""HERSHER: ...Or family members who can lend you money. But imagine if you're living on a fixed income, or you have a disability or young kids - getting insufficient help from FEMA can mean no safe place to live, and that can be really dangerous."", ""CHATTERJEE: Yeah. And it sounds like that's what happened to Donnie and her husband, right?"", 'HERSHER: Yeah, exactly. So when Hurricane Laura hit last August, Donnie and Steve sheltered in place in their mobile home. And there were 150-mile-an-hour winds.', 'What was it like here during the storm? I guess, did a lot of trees snap?', 'SPEIGHT: Oh. There were three big pines over there, huge pines. One of them is the one that landed in the bedroom (ph).', 'CHATTERJEE: Oh, gosh.', 'HERSHER: Yeah. Yeah, this tree put a two-foot hole in the bedroom ceiling. And it knocked out the electricity. It destroyed the air conditioner. And they really relied on the electricity for the electric lift that helped Donnie get Steve in and out of bed safely, to charge his electric wheelchair and charge the nebulizer he needed to help him breathe, and it was dangerously hot in the house. The Speights did not have home insurance. They lived on a fixed income. They did not have the money to repair the damage on their own. So they applied for help from FEMA.', 'CHATTERJEE: And presumably, they hoped that FEMA would give them enough money to fix the hole in the roof and get electricity and air conditioning as soon as possible.', 'HERSHER: Right.', 'CHATTERJEE: What happened?', 'HERSHER: So Donnie says FEMA gave her $1,649. That was $1,200 to fix the roof, plus about $400 for a generator.', 'CHATTERJEE: But after a big disaster, prices for repairs and equipment can really skyrocket.', ""HERSHER: Yeah. Right. And actually, that's a good point. Donnie said that the cheapest generator she could find was $900, and a contractor told them that the roof repair would cost twice as much as FEMA gave them. They were living month to month on Social Security and Steve's benefits from the VA. Steve served in Vietnam. They used the savings they had to cover the cost of that generator, but the roof repair was out of their reach financially. So they lived with the hole in the bedroom ceiling all winter. And you can see the sky through this thing."", 'CHATTERJEE: Wow.', 'HERSHER: This is Louisiana. It rains all the time. The water came right in. Plus, remember; there was that terrible deep freeze this winter.', 'CHATTERJEE: Oh, very stressful circumstances for anyone. But, I mean, for Donnie, she was caring for Steve through all this time.', ""HERSHER: Yeah, and doing her best. But, you know, she's 77 years old. She has arthritis. The damage in the house made everything harder, especially since the hole in the roof was right next to Steve's hospital bed in the bedroom, so caring for him was that much more difficult when the weather was bad. And this spring, Steve's health really deteriorated."", ""SPEIGHT: I went through some hard times there, we say. But we would've been married 39 years the 2 of this month."", ""HERSHER: Wow. That's a long time."", ""Steve died in March, and Donnie says their final months together, they would have been calmer and easier if the house wasn't in such disrepair and if they'd gotten enough money to fix the damage."", 'CHATTERJEE: And I imagine there are thousands of people like Donnie.', ""HERSHER: Yeah. Actually, it's more like hundreds of thousands of low-income people who potentially don't get the help they need. And FEMA now acknowledges that the disparities in who receives disaster assistance, that those are a problem, which is a change. For decades, FEMA has argued that its disaster programs are fair. I interviewed Keith Turi. He is FEMA's assistant administrator for recovery."", ""KEITH TURI: We do understand our obligation to support disaster survivors in an equitable way. That is a responsibility that we have here at FEMA. And candidly, we have work to do there, and we're committed to following through on it."", ""HERSHER: He says the agency is studying these disparities. They are asking local officials for feedback about how people of different demographics are or aren't served by FEMA's current programs. And the new head of FEMA, Deanne Criswell, she testified before a subcommittee in Congress last week and said that equity is one of the top three priorities for the agency. But the agency didn't respond to questions from NPR about specific changes it's considering or what the timeline is for any of this."", ""CHATTERJEE: I mean, Becky, you've covered FEMA for a long time. What's your sense of whether things will change?"", ""HERSHER: You know, it's hard to say. I think there are some basic things that we can look for. You know, will FEMA change its application process or eligibility requirements? Will it start publishing demographic information about who receives assistance? These are concrete things that the agency says it's considering, but it's too soon to know if they'll actually happen."", ""CHATTERJEE: But in the meantime, you're going to bring us more on this topic next week."", ""HERSHER: Yes. Yes, I am. So on this very show next week, we're going to talk about racial disparities in who gets help after disasters. And we're going to focus on the city of Port Arthur, Texas.

She owned a manufactured home at the Medford Estates — what was once a gated, manicured mobile home park with cleanly paved streets, sturdy homes and bright green lawns — until Sept. 8th. That's when the Almeda Fire raged through Jackson County, destroying 2,500 homes within hours."", 'Five months after the fire, the crumpled remains of Meunier’s house overlooks an expanse of ashes and twisted metal. She and her adult son, who has disabilities, are living at a friend’s house as they search for housing amid a tight market and a severe shortage of affordable homes.', 'They applied for disaster assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but were denied.', '“You are not eligible for housing assistance because you did not prove you lived in the damaged home at the time of the disaster,” Meunier reads from the letter FEMA sent her. “I’ve been there since August 2012! Who’s been paying the rent? Who’s been paying mortgage and property taxes?”', 'Meunier is among the nearly 14,000 Oregonians who were denied federal disaster assistance after last year’s wildfires, according to data provided by the agency. She’s also one of the few people who have appealed FEMA’s decisions. About 290 people in Oregon appealed FEMA’s denials. Only 40 of those were approved. Meunier wasn’t among them.', 'Meunier wants to go back home. She wants to live in the same park, in the same plot, in a similar house. The park is leasing plots on a first-come, first-serve basis, without prioritizing previous tenants. New tenants will need to buy a home among a selection of designs provided by the park, and prices are going to be tens of thousands of dollars more than what Meunier paid nine years ago. She owned her previous home outright. It was easier to afford the monthly mortgage payments along with space rent when her late husband was alive.', 'Meunier guesses she’ll need another $30,000 to move back to the park. She’s not sure what she’ll do if she doesn’t make up that shortfall. Still, she plans to appeal FEMA’s denial a third time.', '“I’m going to fight,” Meunier says. “Whatever it takes.”', 'Oregon’s high rates of denial are on par with previous natural disasters. FEMA denied about ', ' after Hurricane Maria. A study by ', ', a housing nonprofit, found that FEMA denied a quarter of disaster applicants after Hurricane Harvey.', 'Many of the people who have been denied assistance are low-income. Among Hurricane Harvey applicants, people whose annual incomes were below $15,000 had a 46% denial rate. People with annual incomes exceeding $70,000 had a 10% denial rate.', 'JPR has a pending data request with FEMA to obtain income and demographic information about Oregon applicants who were impacted by wildfires in 2020.', 'Following Oregon’s wildfires, FEMA issued press releases encouraging people to appeal. They said the appeals process could be as simple as correcting a typo or providing a missing document.', 'Disaster victim advocates and legal aid attorneys say appealing FEMA’s denials is anything but simple; and that by denying so many people the first time, the agency is using a complex bureaucratic process to weed out people who likely need the most help.', ""“People who’ve been affected by a disaster are dealing with trauma,” says attorney Tracy Figueroa with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid. “They're trying to pull the documents together, and just hearing 'no' from one entity or another can shut things down. They don't know how to navigate the bureaucracy. They're just done.”"", 'Figueroa and other legal aid attorneys say applicants almost always need an attorney to help them find and deliver documents, provide context for their living situations, and continually follow up with FEMA representatives.', 'People with limited resources are less likely to have access to a lawyer. Disaster-prone states like Texas, where Figueroa has worked through 18 federal disasters, have teams of legal aid attorneys that help low-income disaster victims. But in states like Oregon, which rarely sees a disaster as destructive as the Almeda Fire, there are few private or nonprofit attorneys who are experienced in FEMA disaster assistance.', 'FEMA’s denial letters aren’t always clear about how applicants can amend their applications. For example, several Oregon applicants told JPR that they were denied assistance because they have homeowner’s insurance; a common misunderstanding, since FEMA often lists homeowners insurance as a reason for denial. Rather, FEMA can help people with homeowners insurance, but those applicants need to follow a few other steps first. They need to see what their insurance will cover and provide that documentation to FEMA, then they need to apply for a loan through the Small Business Administration, even if they don’t intend to take out a loan. At that point, they could go back to FEMA with an appeal.', 'Some applicants have also encountered language barriers, including Meunier, who primarily speaks Spanish. When she called the FEMA help line and asked for Spanish services, she received an English-speaking representative who used a translator located at a separate call center. They said they couldn’t transfer her to a Spanish-speaking FEMA representative; instead, they had to use a translator from the call center.', ""“They don't realize, in the translation, a lot of things get messed up,” Meunier says. “You cannot literally translate spoken words.”"", 'When someone applies for disaster assistance through FEMA, the agency feeds their information through a third-party service, according to ', '.', 'If someone’s information doesn’t match up with that service’s database, it spits out a denial. People often receive eligibility determinations within hours of submitting their applications. ', ""FEMA's automated data verification can be problematic for people with unconventional living conditions. If someone was informally living out of a garage or a spare bedroom — or living in a mobile home with a title that never formally transferred to their name — they’re more likely to get denied assistance. If they have a Spanish name that is sometimes Anglicized or misspelled — or they have two last names that are sometimes hyphenated, sometimes not — they’re also more likely to be denied. It could get particularly tricky if a family includes undocumented parents with a child who is a U.S. Citizen."", 'If there are multiple households living on a property — like roommates sharing a home, or multiple families in different buildings with the same address — only one of them could apply for assistance. If the same address gets multiple applications for assistance, they’re more likely to be denied.', 'These factors tend to leave out historically marginalized people with low incomes, says Sarah Saadian of the Low Income Housing Coalition. ', ""“These programs are not designed to serve people with the greatest needs,” Saadian says. “And so, it's unsurprising that we keep seeing these outcomes over and over again.”"", 'The most common reason people are denied assistance in their initial applications is because of a clerical error or a missing document, according to FEMA spokesperson Jassiel Olivero Melo. She wouldn’t say if the agency was working on improving its disaster assistance applications to alleviate this common mistake.', ""“If the agency finds that there may be something in the application process that is causing applicants to fall short or needs some [interpretation], I am very sure the agency will improve it, if that's the particular case,” Melo says."", 'Jackson County officials say two-thirds of the homes destroyed by the Almeda Fire were manufactured homes. Like Meunier, mobile homeowners face a number of challenges in applying for disaster assistance. They need to provide months-long proof that they paid space rent, a copy of their lease agreement, and a title to their home, which isn’t always available because of the generally informal process of buying a mobile home.', ""“For people who are living in mobile homes, they may not have those title documents,” Saadian says. “Even if your state may require you to register it, it just doesn't happen like that. Sometimes the park owner might have it. Sometimes it's never delivered when the home is delivered.”"", 'Saadian and the Low Income Housing Coalition are encouraging FEMA and Congress to enact legislation that allows mobile homeowners to self-certify homeownership in lieu of title documents, a process that had been allowed after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. FEMA only allows self-attestation in U.S. territories, not in the states.', 'Mobile home parks have historically been located in areas that are susceptible to natural disasters, including wildfires and hurricanes.', ""“They're in areas where wildfires occur and where flooding can occur because they're tucked away,” says attorney Ilene Jacobs with the California Rural Legal Assistance. “Some of them are quite substandard and are in areas adjacent to a highway.”"", 'The Almeda Fire burned through the Bear Creek Greenway, a riparian area and bike path running along the Interstate 5 freeway. Several manufactured home parks abutted the greenway and freeway before the fire raged through those properties.', ""Jacobs has spent years working closely with disaster assistance groups and legal-aid clients. She says every time there's a disaster, the same patterns arise: high rates of denial, low rates of appeals, and large numbers of low-income families falling through the cracks."", '""These are lessons that we should have learned a long time ago and not learn every time there\'s a disaster,"" Jacobs says.

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO', 'Lawyers for local residents said Warren is not alone in her dismay. FEMA’s individual assistance program is something of a “black box,” they said, and rarely gives applicants what they need to repair their homes or replace their belongings. The process of determining how much each victim receives is built around the in-person inspection, in which a federal contractor spends roughly 30 minutes documenting the damage and reviewing paperwork. (When a home is difficult to reach or unsafe to visit, FEMA relies on satellite photos and other information to conduct a geospatial inspection.)', 'Denials are fast and furious: In Texas, roughly half of the 741,000 applicants were rejected for any aid at all. The most common reason is that the “home is habitable,” according to FEMA data.', 'Asked how FEMA decides how much money each family will get, Jenny Burke, FEMA’s press secretary, directed POLITICO to the agency’s ', ' on its individual assistance program, which provides details on everything from the requirements for receiving aid to the appeals process to how FEMA will recoup overpayments. Yet it says little about how FEMA determines a monetary figure.', 'Burke, in an email, explained that FEMA maintains a database of prices for damaged property — from common household goods to structural components of the home — which determines how much a family receives for its losses. The prices are updated quarterly but FEMA does not publish them “because they can be vastly different for each county/state.”', 'Often, residents come away with little or nothing. That’s because Congress never intended for FEMA to make people whole after a disaster. In fact, the underlying law — the Stafford Act — allows FEMA to provide assistance to restore a house only to “a safe and sanitary living or functioning condition.” In its guidance document, FEMA explains that assistance is available only for certain repairs, including structural components of the home, critical utilities and other hazards, such as wet or moldy drywall and carpet. “It is not intended to return the home to its pre-disaster conditions,” the document says.', 'As a result, even heavily damaged households usually don’t receive anything close to the maximum FEMA assistance of $34,000. In Houston, the average grant is roughly $4,300.', '“Congress wants to have their cake and eat it too,” said a former FEMA official. “They want to help everyone after a disaster — but not too much.”', 'These limitations frustrate advocates for the poor, who argue that, unlike the middle and upper classes, low-income homeowners don’t have the savings to make repairs not covered by FEMA. And while middle- and upper-class neighborhoods tend to rebound quickly after disasters — helped along by flood insurance that can restore homes to mint condition — lower-income neighborhoods can be scarred for decades.', '“When it comes to some of the most challenging needs, it’s like no one wants to be stuck holding the hot potato,” said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “Congress says its FEMA’s job. And FEMA says it a state’s job. And states are often now saying it’s the local government’s job. No one wants to be left saying we hold the responsibility for making sure the lowest-income people are at least made whole after a disaster.”', 'Yentel and other advocates say FEMA’s appeals process is particularly difficult for low-income residents. On the surface, it seems straightforward: Applicants who believe they were wrongly denied assistance may submit a form explaining their dispute and providing supporting documentation. But applicants often do not know the reason behind their rejection, making it difficult to know what information to include. Rejection letters typically provide very brief explanations that can be interpreted in multiple ways.', 'Tracy Figueroa, a lawyer at Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, said that when FEMA rejects applicants because of insufficient damage, it could mean any of three things: that the inspector determined that the home wasn’t damaged by the disaster; that the home was damaged but is safe to live in; or that the home is unsafe to live in but the applicant can afford to fix it.', '“There’s three separate concepts and that cryptic notice doesn’t tell you which of the three,” said Figueroa. “You have to basically respond to each of those three concepts to cover your bases.”', 'To improve their clients’ chances, lawyers often request the full inspection files from FEMA, allowing them to better target their appeal. After Harvey, however, an overburdened FEMA was slow to deliver the inspection files, delaying the appeals.', 'In any case, most poor households don’t have access to lawyers like Figueroa to assist with their appeals. As a result, many don’t appeal their rejections at all.', '\nGreg Holden, 52, is shown April 18 outside his Houston home, which was heavily damaged following Hurricane Harvey. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO', '“When there is so much burden on the homeowner to collect everything that might possibly be an obstacle to getting assistance, it just discourages them from appealing altogether,” Figueroa said. “It’s a lot of work. … All those things pick away at somebody’s persistence.”', 'Burke, the FEMA press secretary, said the agency', 'held focus groups with disaster survivors to “provide feedback on their clarity” and revised the letters in 2016 and 2017. The agency plans to “further refine” the letters in late 2018, she added.', '“FEMA is committed to making communications with survivors as clear and concise as possible,” she said.', 'Burke also acknowledged that the agency faced challenges responding quickly to requests for inspection files last fall. “Due to the historic nature of the 2017 disaster season, FEMA experienced a backlog of over 5,000 requests from survivors to receive their inspection files,” she said. “Additional staff was allocated to this area and the backlog was completed in early April.”', 'At a congressional hearing in April, FEMA Administrator Long said the agency is considering whether to speed up the assistance process by reducing the number of in-person inspections and replacing them with geospatial inspections.', '“[An in-home inspection] is an arduous bureaucratic process when we have technology that can say ‘Yes, it’s damaged,’” Long said. “But it puts me in a tough spot because we have to protect the taxpaying dollar against fraud but we also have to move at lightning speed.”', '***', 'For much of America’s history, Congress funded disasters individually, creating an inconsistent, ad-hoc system that angered victims of those catastrophes that failed to evoke congressional action. In 1950, Congress decided to formalize the system, giving the president broad authority to respond to disasters. Over the next few decades, lawmakers slowly expanded those powers, giving numerous agencies a role in disaster recovery.', 'With no lead agency coordinating those efforts, state officials grew frustrated at overlapping duties and worried that resources were being misused. To address those concerns, President Jimmy Carter signed an ', ' on March 31, 1979, that officially established FEMA as the lead agency coordinating federal response and preparedness efforts. Soon afterward, Congress undertook its own study and passed the ', ' in 1988 to further empower FEMA.', 'The law was meant to simplify the system, but many agencies continue to have roles in responding to emergencies, from the Department of Labor to the Department of Agriculture.', 'And the Stafford Act itself is a study in contradictions. Lawmakers wanted to help communities recover, minimize fraud and preserve incentives for households to prepare for future disasters. But those goals are in tension: The more money FEMA provides disaster victims, the less incentive they have to prepare for a storm, and the faster FEMA doles out that money, the greater risk that some of it will fall into fraudulent hands.', 'As a result, 30 years after President Ronald Reagan signed the Stafford Act into law, the disaster recovery system is anything but simple, with overlapping funding schemes and an alphabet soup of federal agencies involved in any response. The result, according to current and former officials, community advocates, and other disaster recovery experts, is a bureaucracy that is tough for even seasoned experts to follow, much less people with language problems or without access to computers. For them, the system can be almost entirely unnavigable.', '\n', '\nBy DANNY VINIK', '“Inequities and problems, particularly for low-income people, and especially for low-income people of color, are built inherently into each stage of the disaster recovery process,” said John Henneberger, co-director of Texas Housers, a nonprofit focused on low-income housing issues in Texas.', 'In Texas, homeowners theoretically', 'have many options.

The Partial Repairs and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program is available only to homeowners with less than $17,000 in damage and will only fund temporary repairs. It is designed to get homeowners quickly back to functioning, if not exactly comfortable, homes.', 'The second program, Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR), provides permanent repairs to homes with more than $17,000 in damage. However, repairs cannot exceed either $60,000 or 50 percent of the home’s value.', 'The range of options — and the rules and requirements that come with each of them — leaves low-income victims confused and frustrated at some of the most challenging moments of their lives. Unlike middle- and upper-income homeowners, they often have little experience with government bureaucracy and don’t have the resources or capacity to figure it out.', '“My impression is that low-income homeowners in Northeast Houston really have no idea what the hell is going on at all. They are very confused,” said Ben Hirsch, a relief worker with West Street Recovery. “There’s your FEMA grant and your SBA loan, and PREPS and DALHR.”', 'There are also myriad charitable groups, Hirsch added. “Then, there are also a bunch of scams.”', 'Even taken together, the programs represent something of a Swiss cheese approach to disaster recovery, providing some support but leaving big holes. FEMA, for instance, offers a moderate amount of assistance to qualified applicants but relies on other programs, which are often underfunded and slow to launch, to fill in the cracks.', '“People who qualify for FEMA grant dollars are not in good financial situations in the first place,” said Fugate, the former FEMA administrator. “It’s a bridge, but sometimes it’s a bridge to nowhere if you aren’t able to find other programs to meet your needs.”', 'After flood insurance and FEMA assistance, the next tier of federal disaster assistance comes from SBA, which offers low-rate loans to disaster victims. Despite its name, SBA lends out far more money to individuals after a disaster than to businesses. In fact, as of early January, SBA ', ' more than $3 billion to Harvey victims— and 90 percent of that had gone to residents.', 'For many middle- and high-income families without flood insurance, an SBA loan is attractive because the terms are better than those from private lenders. But many low-income families do not have enough income to qualify for an SBA loan; if they do, many are unable to take on the debt.', 'The state-level programs help some homeowners but are available only for specific people. Homeowners with more than $17,000 in damage are ineligible for PREPS, for instance, while DALHR has such specific guidelines that, according to data released by the Texas government, repairs had been completed on just 214 homes as of May 4.', '***', '\n', 'Holden‘s Houston home is shown seven months after Hurricane Harvey hit. In Texas, roughly half of the 741,000 FEMA applicants were rejected for any aid at all. The most common reason is that the “home is habitable,” according to FEMA data. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO', 'For low-income disaster victims, the final and most important pot of money comes from HUD in the form of its Community Development Block Grant program.', 'The CDBG program typically funds local projects for a variety of reasons, from retaining businesses to increasing the supply of affordable housing. When a disaster hits, the program also, sometimes, provides disaster grants to states, cities and local governments, which then can distribute that money to their residents.', 'Most importantly, the money is earmarked for the poor. As a rule, at least 70 percent of the money must principally help low- and middle-income homeowners.', 'But the CDBG disaster recovery program has major problems as well. Grants often take more than a year to reach disaster victims. Unlike FEMA, HUD doesn’t have an existing fund to make grants when a disaster strikes. Instead, Congress must approve additional spending, a process that sometimes takes months. Smaller disasters rarely receive CDBG disaster grants. Once Congress passes new funding, HUD must issue new rules in the Federal Register for how a state can use the grants. The state must then draft and seek public comment on a spending plan before submitting it to HUD for approval.', '“It’s a challenge,” said Yentel. “Every disaster, the rules are reconsidered and sometimes rewritten. That certainly slows things down.”', 'Tombar, the former HUD official, put it this way: “[The process] takes a whole lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, on the back end of all that, you have more human suffering and misery because people who have the greatest need are waiting for those resources.”', 'In early September, after Hurricane Harvey struck the Gulf Coast, Congress quickly passed a $15 billion disaster spending bill, including $7.4 billion for CDBG disaster grants. In February, lawmakers approved an additional $28 billion in CDBG disaster grants. Community advocates are eager to put that money to use. Huey Wilson, the president of a local community organization near Kashmere Gardens called Trinity Gardens Super Neighborhood, said nonprofit groups desperately need new resources to continue repairing people’s homes.', '“Donations for supplies are drying up,” she said.', 'But Wilson doesn’t expect that money to reach communities like hers until August or September.', 'In early February, HUD ', ' that just over $5 billion of the first bloc of CDBG money was earmarked for Texas, which quickly began working on its state plan. That plan, unveiled in mid-April, was available for comment until May 1. The state’s General Land Office submitted its ', ' to HUD for approval on May 8.', 'That money is more than three times the $1.6 billion that FEMA has distributed to Harvey victims through its individual assistance program. But on the ground in Houston, few residents are even aware of it.', '“The homeowners we work with have never even heard of CDBG money,” said Hirsch, the relief worker.', 'Even when the HUD dollars begin flowing, though, they are all but guaranteed to fall short.', 'For one, Congress almost always underfunds the program. In Texas, the General Land Office, which is responsible for drafting its action plan, estimates that even after the $5 billion in CDBG money, the state will still need roughly $100 billion to rebuild, including more than $10 billion in housing assistance.', '“There’s never enough money,” said Pete Phillips, the staff lead on the program in Texas. He added that a permanent CDBG disaster grant program “would be beneficial across the board.”', 'Meanwhile, advocates for the poor say Texas has chosen to use a faulty formula to allocate the CDBG money among different priorities, such as housing, infrastructure and other state goals, and among different counties. According to the formula, which was developed by HUD to determine “serious unmet needs” after a disaster, homeowners with less than $8,000 in damage or whose home had less than 1 foot of flooding do not have a “serious unmet need.” Renters with less than $2,000 in property damage are also excluded.', 'Many low-income homeowners fall beneath those thresholds, simply because their homes or belongings aren’t worth much on the open market. Charlie Duncan, research director at Texas Housers, said Texas’ decision to use the formula causes money to be disproportionately shifted from poor, minority neighborhoods like Kashmere Gardens to more affluent areas.', '“About two-thirds of very low-income households are being cut out of ‘unmet needs,’” said Duncan. “You have entire communities across the state who are at or below 30 percent of the median income. These entire communities stand to not receive what they can to recover. This is a major problem.”', '\n', 'Displaced by Harvey, Jacqueline Pope stays in a one-bedroom motel room with her husband and three kids. To pay for expenses, Pope said she had to pawn her wedding ring. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO', 'Duncan recommends that Texas adopt a different formula, assessing damages relative to a resident’s income level. Under such a system, the unmet needs of low and moderate-income homeowners would increase by more than $1 billion when compared to the formula Texas is using. Low-income areas like Kashmere Gardens would be a major beneficiary.', '“We [would be] providing a proportional recovery,” he said, “and making sure that everyone at these income levels is being assisted as fairly as possible.”', 'Phillips, the state official, disputed Duncan’s comment, saying the state agency must use the HUD formula. “We’re limited by the data that HUD provides us,” he said. Texas did include additional factors to account for certain neighborhood challenges, like an inability to raise funds, he said. Still, Phillips said, he wouldn’t object to an HUD formula that better estimated unmet needs.', '“More accurate data is always a good thing,” he said. “If they want to provide us with more granularity, we aren’t going to complain.”', 'However, Duncan, in an ', ' submitted to the state land office, pointed to language in the Federal Register notice directing the state to “develop a needs assessment” without requiring the state to adopt HUD’s specific formula.', 'Asked about the formula, a HUD spokesperson declined to comment.', '***', 'Petra Cervantes, a Mexican emigrant, lives in northeast Houston with her husband, Raul, who doesn’t speak English, and their two kids and two grandkids. FEMA gave the family a grant of $25,000 after the storm to help with repairs. The money covered less than half the total damages, which exceeded $50,000. But by spring, Cervantes said, nearly 80 percent of their home had been rebuilt.', 'Soon after, a member of Pastor’s Army, an informal group founded after Harvey to assist families in rebuilding, visited their home, telling Cervantes that it still had mold and recommending that they start the rebuilding from scratch. The pastor, Cervantes recalled, said the family would be able to move back in within weeks, telling her, “We are professionals and know what we are doing.” She agreed to have her nearly rebuilt house gutted.', '\n', 'At left, Aaron Cervantes, 4, sleeps inside his grandparents’ house. At their highest point, Harvey’s floodwaters reached just below the electrical box, at right. More than eight months after the storm, the Cervantes family has made little progress rebuilding their home. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO', '“I believed him because that’s a church,” Cervantes said.', 'Nearly a month-and-a-half later, that rebuilding hadn’t begun. The house has no walls inside, so the family is living in a large tent in their driveway. On a recent visit, Cervantes’ two 4-year-old grandchildren were asleep on cots inside the hollowed-out home, lying just feet away from exposed electrical wires. Flies buzzed around the backyard where the family keeps chickens and rabbits. More than a dozen dogs, many unkempt with a powerful odor, ran around the home.', 'Navigating a web of nonprofit organizations, private companies and home-repair contractors is yet another challenge facing low-income disaster victims. Often, these groups are well-intentioned, but they may lack the knowledge or experience to help with rebuilding, potentially providing bad advice or raising expectations about how quickly a family can move back into their home.', 'Sometimes, these groups have more malicious motives, seeking to rip off homeowners. Scams proliferate widely in the aftermath of a disaster, experts said, and low-income disaster victims, particularly people of color and immigrants, might have more trouble distinguishing credible organizations from fraudulent ones, making them easy marks. Stories abound of people impersonating FEMA inspectors, looking to steal a disaster victim’s personal information, or fake contractors taking payment for a proposed job and never performing the work.', 'In Cervantes’ case, she said that Pastor’s Army abandoned the project.', 'Rick Aldridge, who founded Pastor’s Army and worked on emergency management issues for the Air Force, disputed Cervantes’ story, saying that he never gave her a timeline for completing the project. He also said he offered her the option of either gutting the house or making a less-extensive repair that risked leaving some mold. She chose to rebuild the whole house, he said.', 'Pastor’s Army worked on the home until Cervantes said a relative would replace the electrical wiring. The project, Aldridge said, is now paused until Cervantes completes the rewiring and obtains a permit for further work. Once that happens, he said, Pastor’s Army will be happy to finish rebuilding her home.', '“We have offered to go back and finish her home, but she hasn’t called us,” he said.', 'In fact, Aldridge said, the real problem stems from the initial work that was done on Cervantes’ home, which he called “not very good” and left considerable amounts of mold. That wasn’t a huge surprise. Subpar work is often a problem after disasters. Aldridge explained that volunteer contractors are desperately needed but often have little experience rebuilding homes. Even well-intentioned groups make mistakes that have serious consequences for homeowners.', '“We know [young volunteers] probably aren’t very experienced at rebuilding, but they do bring adult supervision and leadership that know how to do it. And we tend to supervise each of the houses,” he said. “Not every group has that ability. They go in, they literally watch a video about how to gut a house out and go do it. It may not necessarily be right.”', 'Aldridge acknowledged, “There is some shoddy work, unfortunately. We may even do some shoddy work ourselves once in a while because there are so many homes and it goes so fast. We try not to. That’s why our group is slower than most.”', 'The job of policing these organizations falls largely to state and local governments, but they rarely have the resources or manpower necessary to oversee the thousands of contractors that flood into a state seeking work after a disaster.', 'Heather Way, a law professor at the University of Texas, released a ', ' recently finding that the city of Houston had more than 420,000 rental units before Harvey but just two inspectors to check for problems like mold and sewage leaks. The city has recently hired a few more, but that still makes it nearly impossible to police housing-code violations.', '“With Harvey hitting and damaging thousands of units, the problems are only amplified,” said Way.', '\n', '\nBy DANNY VINIK', 'A similar lack of oversight exists for homeowners. Mary Benton, the press secretary for Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, wrote in an email that the city “does not investigate potential scams.” She added, “We do not have oversight over nonprofits not funded by us, private foundations, other governmental entities (unless they are funded by us), or private homeowner investments.”', 'Victor Senties, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, said the department has a special unit called the “swindle squad” to investigate scams like impersonating a government official, but the squad is not focused solely on disaster-related incidents.', 'The Texas attorney general has been more active policing such scams, setting up a toll-free line for residents to report such activities and providing advice for dealing with door-to-door salespeople. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said the agency has received 181 complaints related to contractor fraud after Harvey.', 'At the federal level, FEMA works with the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an umbrella organization of private and nonprofit groups that help disaster victims. But the agency has no role regulating or overseeing groups that contact homeowners.', 'The Justice Department also seeks to protect victims from fraud. In September, it issued ', ' to coordinate investigations and prosecutions for disaster-related fraud. DOJ’s National Center for Disaster Fraud also operates a call center to receive complaints and directs callers to the proper jurisdiction. However, it’s unclear whether homeowners use the agency to report potential fraudulent contractors and other malicious salespeople.', 'Nicole Navas, a DOJ spokeswoman, said, “The vast majority of Harvey complaints to the NCDF relate to alleged identity theft affecting FEMA and Red Cross disbursements and alleged false information submitted by applicants in their FEMA assistance applications.”', 'Nonetheless, more than eight months after Harvey, the Cervantes family has made little progress rebuilding their home.

The Boykins used $40,000 from their flood-insurance policy and $27,000 of their own money to cover repairs. Her walls and floors have been fixed, unlike those of many of her neighbors. She’s waiting on a contractor to finish up a few stray items, but the rebuilding is nearly complete.', 'If another storm strikes, she could be back to square one.', 'At the end of her driveway, crucial drainage ditches dug before Harvey remain filled with debris, trash and other objects, blocking the path for water to escape to a nearby bayou. Downey and Wilson, the local community leaders, implore residents to remove the debris but progress is slow — and the negligence of even a few could result in another disaster for many.', '“We’re very, very concerned about the next storm season,” Downey said. “People are so fragile from the last storm.”', 'In Washington, policymakers also express concern about the next hurricane season. Yet changes are coming slowly. In December, the House approved a disaster spending bill that included a requirement to begin simplifying the recovery system, but it never received a vote in the Senate. More recently, the House attached the same requirement to the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s unclear whether the Senate will take up the changes.', 'While many experts support those reforms, they don’t represent a major redesign of the current system: Among other changes, the bill merely directs FEMA, HUD, SBA and other relevant agencies to submit reports to Congress within a year outlining ways to streamline the process.', '“After [Superstorm] Sandy, it was incredibly complicated for victims of the storm,” Rep.

Some say the improvement is noticeable.', '“We found that FEMA has made a ton of progress since Katrina and Sandy,” said Chris Currie, director of emergency management and national preparedness issues at the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan government watchdog agency.', '“If you look back at Katrina, FEMA’s role was much more reactionary. In this case (Harvey), they have been able to pre-deploy assets before the full disaster strikes.”', 'As of Friday morning, more than 103,000 individuals and households had been approved for FEMA assistance worth more than $66.4 million, the agency said in a press release.', 'Of that amount, $9.5 million had been approved for housing assistance for victims, mainly for help with rent of up to $2,000 a month. Victims are also eligible for a one-time payout of $500 to cover “critical needs” such as diapers, infant formula, food and fuel.', 'FEMA makes emergency grants available as soon as a hurricane or other catastrophe is declared a disaster by the U.S. president. The agency can offer as much as $30,000 per household, but most payments are much smaller.', 'The average payout to Hurricane Katrina victims was $7,114. For Sandy it was $8,016. Those sums might seem modest for victims who have lost everything. But the aid is intended to be temporary, said Rafael Lemaitre, former public affairs director for FEMA until January 2017.', 'The grants “are not designed to make lives whole again. It’s a life vest. It is designed to help the most vulnerable get back on their feet,” he said.', 'Lemaitre said one of the big changes since Katrina is that FEMA is more pro-active in getting help to people faster. Victims can sign up online via FEMA’s new app. The agency also sends teams out into shelters to register people on the spot.', 'Oversight has also been toughened to combat abuses, according to Currie of the GAO. He said around 20 percent of Katrina payouts were lost to fraud and abuse, a rate that was lowered to the 2 percent to 6 percent range with Sandy.', '“A lot of it has to do with technology; you apply on-line, or with a mobile phone,” Currie said. “There is more technology available to make sure the money is going to the right people and verify who it is supposed to go to.”', 'Some Harvey victims say this heightened scrutiny is making their shattered lives even more difficult.', 'At the Houston convention center shelter, a 59-year-old man who would only give his first name, Tyrone, said FEMA has denied him assistance because he does not own the flooded home where he lives; it is still in the name of his mother, who died 18 months ago.', 'Tyrone said he could not retitle it in his name because his mother left the house to all six of her children.

Today on the show, why the federal government's response to disasters is unfair to people of color and how that can ripple through entire communities. You're listening to SHORT WAVE, the daily science podcast from NPR."", '(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)', ""CHATTERJEE: Becky, let's start with some basics about FEMA. This is the agency that helps people get back on their feet after disasters, right? What do we know about who exactly gets FEMA help?"", ""HERSHER: Right. So FEMA is providing this really crucial housing assistance - so money to repair your house or pay rent, basically. And this is what our investigation found. So if you're poor, you're less likely to receive some types of housing assistance. And when you do get money, you often receive less. And FEMA's own internal analyses confirm this. But here's the catch. Academic research shows that there are similar disparities between white disaster survivors and people of color, but FEMA says it has not conducted similar analyses about race."", ""CHATTERJEE: So there's this research evidence showing all of this. What did you find about how that's really bearing out for families and entire communities?"", ""HERSHER: Yeah, so that's why I went to Port Arthur. You know, for years, I've been running across individual families in Black and Latinx neighborhoods who had trouble getting help from FEMA after hurricanes specifically. But the research I was reading suggested that entire neighborhoods were being affected. And Port Arthur is a really good place to go if you want to see the effects of hurricanes on whole neighborhoods because it's surrounded by water, it is right on the Gulf of Mexico, and it's been hit by four hurricanes since 2005."", 'CHATTERJEE: Wow.', 'HERSHER: And FEMA has provided assistance after every one of those storms.', ""CHATTERJEE: But it sounds like the assistance hasn't really helped Port Arthur's Black neighborhoods. Becky, what did you learn about why Black residents haven't gotten adequate help?"", 'HERSHER: Right. So one reason seems to be a kind of paperwork issue. And I saw a really good example of this in a neighborhood called El Vista in Port Arthur. So this is one of the few places that Black residents could live when the city was officially segregated. It is extremely low lying, and it got hit really hard by Hurricane Harvey back in 2017.', '(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)', ""BEARD: Everything here got flooded - everything. And I'm going to really show you something that's going to blow your mind."", 'HERSHER: So John Beard took me down to visit a homeowner who lives there. Her name is Shirley Payne (ph).', 'BEARD: Hi. How are you doing?', 'UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hi. Can I help you?', 'BEARD: Miss Payne home?', ""HERSHER: And Shirley's house is brick. It's one of the only ones left on her block. She raised her kids in this house. She raised her grandchildren in this house. And when we arrived, her great-granddaughters were playing outside. But during Harvey, she had four feet of water in this house. And she says the only reason she was able to rebuild is because she didn't have to rely on FEMA. She had insurance, but she says a lot of her neighbors, they weren't so lucky. They needed money from FEMA, but they didn't have the paperwork that showed they owned their homes."", '(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)', ""SHIRLEY PAYNE: A lot of people, the houses wasn't in their name."", 'CHATTERJEE: I mean, is this because the houses were passed down through families?', ""HERSHER: Yeah, a lot of them were, exactly. Like, maybe the house was in a grandparent's name or a sibling's name or maybe it was owned collectively, you know, so it had been passed down and each family got a little piece of the ownership over the years."", 'CHATTERJEE: Yeah, yeah.', ""HERSHER: And that's really common in many historically segregated communities in the U.S. Payne says it took months or even years to iron out the paperwork for houses like that. And elderly neighbors and people with young kids, they just couldn't wait that long for stable housing. They couldn't afford to pay the cost of a hotel or an apartment, and that left them no choice but to leave."", ""PAYNE: A lot of these houses you see down the street here, the one that's still boarded up, that's this result of Harvey. It's just sad. It's just sad."", ""HERSHER: Today, about a quarter of the houses around there are empty. And I asked Shirley's granddaughter if she would want to inherit her grandmother's house, you know, raise her daughters there, and she said no, that she feels like Black Port Arthur is dying."", 'CHATTERJEE: And is there evidence that this type of thing is happening in other places after disasters?', ""HERSHER: Yeah, so proving homeownership, this problem, it has showed up in Black neighborhoods after Hurricane Katrina. It has showed up for residents of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. And there's a growing body of research that actually uses census data and financial data to try to quantify what those disparities do to families. So, for example, there was this study done after Hurricane Harvey and it focused on Houston. And it found that bankruptcy rates spiked by almost 40% after the hurricane in neighborhoods where racial minorities lived."", 'CHATTERJEE: Wow.', 'HERSHER: Because people in those neighborhoods were less likely to receive some types of FEMA assistance.', ""CHATTERJEE: And what is FEMA's response to this?"", ""HERSHER: Well, FEMA acknowledges it has a problem. I interviewed Keith Turi. He is FEMA's assistant administrator for recovery. And he said the first step is for the agency to start gathering data about race."", '(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)', ""KEITH TURI: We're not currently collecting demographic data for the survivors that we serve. We do plan to add that to our collection in the near future."", 'CHATTERJEE: And did he give details on what the near future meant in terms of a time frame?', ""HERSHER: No, he didn't. And FEMA didn't respond to any follow-up questions about how this would work or whether that information would be available to the public or any other concrete steps it's taking to make its programs more fair."", ""CHATTERJEE: OK, so they are not telling you anything about this. But, I mean, you've talked to a lot of experts, right, Becky? What are some potential solutions here to address these racial disparities?"", ""HERSHER: Right. So, yeah, I really focused on interviewing disaster experts and sociologists especially about this. And one idea that came up a lot is to limit who's eligible for FEMA assistance, you know, make it more like SNAP benefits or Medicaid. So only people below a certain income or wealth threshold would be eligible. Another idea is to stop relying on disaster survivors to apply for help. You know, basically use the information the government already has to get money to those who need it the most, including people in marginalized communities."", ""CHATTERJEE: So you mean the fact that the government already knows who uses public health care or gets money to pay for food or who's a military veteran or has kids in the school system, so just use that information."", ""HERSHER: Exactly. Yeah. And I talked to Chauncia Willis about this. She's the former emergency manager for Tampa, Fla. And she's also the co-founder of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management. And this is how she put it."", '(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)', ""CHAUNCIA WILLIS: We need to understand first who has the greatest need and who has the least access. And we're going to start from there. When you start from there, it benefits everyone."", ""CHATTERJEE: I mean, that sounds like an obvious, logical approach. But we all know that changing the way a government agency does its work, it's a very slow undertaking. I mean, FEMA didn't even give you a time frame for all of this. Did you hear about anything that might push the agency to be more equitable?"", ""HERSHER: Yeah. So first of all, I have to say, if you ask the agency, it's all about studying the problem and really understanding who is not getting the help they need. Like, if FEMA can fully understand the problem, then FEMA feels it can fix the problem."", ""CHATTERJEE: Sure. But again, that's going to take a long time."", ""HERSHER: Yeah. Yeah. And if you talk to people like Chauncia Willis, she says actually what needs to happen is Congress needs to step in. So there's this law that governs how disaster aid is distributed, and it is all about preventing fraud. That's why all of those stringent requirements exist that we talked about earlier, you know, to prove that you live in a place or that you own your house, for example. But Willis and others say that is slowing FEMA down. It is making it really hard for people to get the help they need and that the law needs to change if FEMA is going to be more equitable. I have to say, though, so far, no one in Congress has seriously proposed that."", '(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)', 'CHATTERJEE: Becky, thank you so much for digging into this and bringing your reporting to the show.

On the floor were tubs marking the areas too soggy to step. In the bathroom, the toilet was tilting because of the rotting floor and the shower had stopped working, leaving her to clean herself up at the kitchen sink.', 'She read back what she had typed, imagining how the words would sound to the people she was sending them to at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Does that sound stupid?” she asked.

There was no explanation this time, just a check for $48, which was followed a few days later by another check, this time for $1,312, also without explanation. She appealed again, saying the money was not nearly enough to cover her damage, and that resulted in another check, again with no explanation, for $2,036. But the contractors had said it would cost $9,400 to fix the roof and the bathroom alone. Kim guessed at what FEMA wanted her to do with the money. She got the branches removed, replaced the insulation so her water pipes wouldn’t freeze, and had the trailer put back on its foundation to stop its shaking. The money wouldn’t stretch far enough to fix the bathroom, though, and it was long gone by the time she was sitting at her desk with her finished appeal letter.', 'The last step was to upload it. “Honest to Pete, I used to know how to do this,” she said as she looked at a list of file options. “Come on, Kimmy,” she said.', 'Frustrated, she went back to the FEMA site and saw a box that explained she needed to upload her letter as a PDF. “A word document will not be accepted,” it said.', '“Oh lordy,” Kim said. “Does it really have to be a PDF file? I have no way to do that.”', 'She went back to her letter and clicked through each toolbar looking for a way to convert the file.', '“I just don’t remember,” she said. “I guess I can’t send this.”', 'But she needed to send it, so she spent 15 minutes more looking through different toolbars. Finally, she stopped clicking and sat back in her chair, wondering what to do next.', '* * *', 'She would have to mail the letter. But before she could do that, she would need to find ink for her printer, which cost money. And make copies of the letter, along with the contractor estimates and photographs of the damage, which cost money, too. And she had nothing but a few coins in her wallet. Before the pandemic and the storm, she had been earning as much as $100 a night driving a taxi. Now fares were scarce, and some nights she couldn’t even cover gas.', 'Kim had grown up in a big family in Cedar Rapids, but the family had fractured, her daughter was rarely in touch, and the last time the park management asked for an emergency contact she had written, “Don’t have anyone.” Mostly, she spent her time watching home improvement shows, like the one playing the next day as she got ready to go to work. She moved around the trailer slowly. Her diabetes was making her dizzy lately. Her knee was giving out, too, and she needed surgery, but she was putting it off until the bathroom was fixed because she was afraid if she sat on her lopsided toilet with her full weight during her recovery, it would surely go through the floor.', 'There were so many small indignities in her life now. She had been taking time off to give her body a break, but the taxi company owner told her that if she worked an overnight dispatch shift, he would pay her right away.', '“We have to make sure everything is ', ' for this family,” the TV host was saying as she turned off the show, and then she was outside for the first time in days, driving past a trailer where a woman was using her nursing school loans for roof repairs, past a trailer where the storm-shattered walls were being held together with duct tape, past a trailer in which a family was living even though the home was missing an entire side, and soon she was at the small dispatch office where she was looking forward to using a bright, clean bathroom.', 'When the sun rose in the morning and the woman on the day shift came to relieve her, Kim asked if the owner was still coming in. “He was going to pay me this morning,” she said.', '“I thought he was, but he told me, ‘Tell Kim I’ll pay her later,’ ” the woman said.', '“Oh, I thought he was coming in now,” Kim said.', '“I have a $10 bill on me if you want it,” the woman said.', 'Kim shook her head. “But that’s nice of you to offer, though.”', 'That night she was back at work again, this time driving a taxi and picking up a woman at a house where the foundation had been damaged by a falling tree.', '“That must have been a huge tree,” Kim said when the woman got in, noticing the stump still embedded in the concrete.', '“Yes, it’s been quite the project,” the woman said and added she was still figuring out what to do after being denied federal help. “I didn’t qualify because of something. It was weird,” she said.', 'Seven months later, the mysteries of FEMA were a constant refrain.', 'A woman who needed a ride to a convenience store told Kim she regretted not fighting for disaster aid after her car was destroyed. “I told my boyfriend, ‘Let’s appeal this,’ but he was like, ‘I had enough,’ ” she said. “It was like we couldn’t handle any more disappointment.”', 'A man with a walker who needed a ride home from the grocery told Kim how he had struggled to apply online and eventually given up. “FEMA kept me waiting. Everything was outside my reach,” he said.', 'In the weeks after the storm, there were so many instances of people being turned down that J’nae Peterman, program director at a Cedar Rapids nonprofit that deals with housing emergencies, raised the issue with a FEMA liaison. “He told me the first step is always to be denied, and then you have to appeal,” Peterman remembered. She remembered him explaining the reason had to do with fraud and abuse, and her responding: “These are people in crisis. They see a denial letter, they throw it away and move on.”', 'Peterman was far from the first person to point this out. In September 2020, the U.S. Government Accountability Office urged FEMA to revise its denial letters after a review found that they lead people to believe that preliminary decisions are final. FEMA has not changed its process, but it has started putting out news releases encouraging survivors to appeal its decisions.', 'Not that Kim or the people in her taxi knew of these discussions. Instead, their conversations were like the one Kim had with her last fare of the night, who was worried about bedbugs. “You’d think the storm would have killed all those. It killed everything else,” the woman said.', '“It killed my house, that’s for sure,” Kim said.', '“Are any of the repairs done yet?”', '“I need a new roof,” Kim said and left it at that.', 'She dropped the woman off and suddenly was crying. All the talk of damage and denials had her worried that her letter wouldn’t be good enough. Her knee was aching. She had made $57 and still needed to fill the taxi with gas.', 'The next day, at a supermarket, she fed her pile of photos and estimates into a copier and pressed buttons trying to make the machine start. Finally, a young clerk came over to help.', '“It was a crazy storm,” he said, seeing the photographs.', 'She had planned to send a certified letter at the post office, but her head was swimming, so she headed back to the trailer to rest. She folded the documents into an envelope. The mail truck would be along soon. She decided to take a chance and leave it in her mailbox.', '“This way, I can just get to work,” she said. “Oh, I hope I make lots of money tonight.”', 'She put three stamps on the envelope, then added a fourth, just to be safe.', 'When she got back home 10 hours later, she pulled up to the circle of light beneath her lamppost. “Let me check,” she said, and looked into the dark mailbox.', '“Well, it’s on its way.”', '* * *', 'The address the letter was headed to was a building in the suburbs of D.C., one of four processing centers that deal with the thousands of versions of Kim who contact FEMA every day.', 'Mostly, their contact comes in the form of phone calls, which can surge to more than 100,000 a day after a major disaster. But written appeals go to these centers as well, to be handled by workers who read them and — if they are persuaded the case deserves another look — call contractors and order inspections to check for fraud, then calculate new awards. The centers are an increasingly vital part of FEMA’s operation. But the agency is best known for how it shows up on-site soon after a disaster, like it did in Iowa, where it set up six drive-through tent centers for people to file applications, including one', 'in the parking lot of the baseball stadium where Kim went to file her first appeal.', 'Kim remembered talking with people wearing the blue FEMA jackets she recognized from TV and driving away feeling optimistic. She went to the stadium because FEMA comes into cities and towns, but it doesn’t typically go into neighborhoods, leaving that to local officials who report back on what is needed. In Kim’s case, the only person who came to her trailer in the days after the storm was a man with an EMT badge who took her blood pressure, whose face she saw again on the news, with a warning that he was posing as a medic and faced felony charges.', 'FEMA kept its tents up in Cedar Rapids until the end of September and in early November closed the window to register for help. As chance would have it, a few days after Kim sent her letter and while she was waiting for a reply, two FEMA officials drove in from Missouri to check with the city on how things had been going. They were meeting with city manager Jeff Pomeranz, who was hoping to do his own version of what Kim was attempting and ask FEMA for more money. In his case, he needed millions of dollars to clear fallen trees on public property.', '“We don’t have mountains and oceans, but what we have is beautiful trees, so we’ve got to get them back,” he said as the meeting began.', 'They were in a basement training room at City Hall. Everyone was wearing masks because of the pandemic. The lights were out, and a mechanic was puzzling over the light switches in one corner. The room had been set up with chairs and tables for the meeting, but the men had stayed standing as they exchanged business cards that were hard to read in the dark.', '“Well, one of the reasons I wanted to stop by is to check, ‘How are we doing?’ ” said DuWayne Tewes, the official overseeing FEMA’s Iowa response. “It sounds like so far no complaints?”', '“Things have really been going very well. I absolutely feel like FEMA was a partner with us all the way,” Pomeranz said, and clasped his hands in front of his chest to emphasize his gratitude.', '“That’s what I love to hear,” Tewes said.', '“We wouldn’t say that if it wasn’t the absolute truth,” Pomeranz said.', '“Great,” Tewes said. He glanced down at his notes for the meeting. “Well, you know, one of the great things I saw was how the community came together,” he said.', '“They still are,” Pomeranz said.', 'Amid such pleasantries, the men continued to stand in the dark, shifting their weight back and forth as the mechanic grabbed a chair, stood on it, and began poking at one of the lights that wasn’t working.', '“All events are different,” Pomeranz said now, moving on to the topic of trees and his hope that FEMA would give the city $60 million for cleanup. “But you know, you lose a structure, as long as no one’s hurt, you can rebuild the structure. But in the case of a tree, you can replant a tree, but before it has the effect of a tree canopy, you’re looking at decades.”', 'The visitors nodded. “It’s a process,” Tewes said, “and we’re doing everything we can,” and as he went on, explaining the process, Pomeranz sighed and put out a hand to support himself against the wall. They had been standing for 40 minutes. The mechanic gave up and left, and Pomeranz thought of one more thing he wanted to check on.', '“What about the Individual Assistance perspective? Has that been going pretty smoothly?” he asked.', '“The registration window has closed, but there might be other avenues,” Tewes said. “There might be a voluntary agency to hook them up with.”', 'Pomeranz smiled and nodded and said, “Okay, great. That was very important to us, and I know the federal government moved on that and just kept things going without a hitch.”', 'After an hour, Tewes asked if there was anything else the agency could offer. Pomeranz shook his head no.', '“We just haven’t had any negative issues,” he said.', '“That’s what I really love hearing,” Tewes said.', '“Absolutely. We’re good.” Pomeranz said. “Sorry the lights were off,” he added as he walked the men back up to the street.', 'Outside, the two officials stood in the sun, masks still in place. “Well, I freely admit, I am very pleased,” Tewes said to the other FEMA officer. “You can’t see it, but I have a giant grin on my face.”', '* * *', 'Ten minutes away from City Hall, Kim lifted her lace curtain because she thought she had heard the mail truck.', 'Nothing.', 'Later, she checked the FEMA site once more. Still nothing. It was her night off, so she turned on a home improvement show where the host was looking with disdain at a windowless bathroom he was supposed to renovate. “It’s a basement bathroom,” he said.', '“Still better than mine,” Kim said.', 'Sometimes, Kim imagined being on the shows she watched. “But there are people more in need,” she said. “And they usually pick families.” She watched as the camera panned over a new toilet and a double vanity sink. Now the host was showing the family their made-over home and the father was crying. “I’d be crying too,” Kim said and fell silent. The episode wasn’t over, but she shut it off.', 'It had been five days since she had sent her letter, and she was wishing she had used certified mail. Had she added enough stamps? Had the return address label fallen off? Would she even know if it never arrived at its destination?', 'On the sixth day, she found an Internet shut-off notice in her mailbox and called the company. “I’ve never missed a payment and the one time I’m late you’re going to shut me off?” she said. The representative agreed to give her a few more days, and Kim put the letter next to the overdue car insurance bill and water bill, which had tripled since her toilet began leaking after the storm.', 'At the one-week mark, she was back at work and got lucky with a $108 fare. Internet paid, insurance paid, water bill paid. “That’s something,” she said.', 'At the two-week mark, the park management put up a sign saying “Spring inspections are starting,” and told Kim that she needed to bring the outside of her trailer up to standard if she wanted to keep living there. She promised to get it repainted that month.', 'Day after day was the same. Wake up. Clean herself at the kitchen sink. Check the FEMA site. Check the mail. Go to work. Watch a show. And spend the last hours of the night on a street where it was too dark to see the twisted trees and tarped roofs, too dark to see anything but little pools of light here and there, and in one of them was Kim at her desk checking the FEMA site one more time before she went to sleep.', 'And then came the 26th day, when Kim checked the site and saw a letter waiting for her.', '“ASSISTANCE NOT APPROVED,” it began.', 'She read it slowly, then read it over again, looking for a reason and seeing nothing except that she had received “all eligible assistance for this type of loss.”', 'Her printer was still out of ink, and so she began copying down the letter by hand for her records. Her chest was tight and it was hard to breathe. Despite everything, part of her had believed that the agency would give her more help. She copied down the words “you are not eligible,” and then the word “ineligible,” and then she stopped writing and started to cry. She shut off her computer, washed herself in the kitchen sink, turned off the lights and went to bed.', 'She wasn’t going to write to FEMA anymore. She wasn’t going to appeal. She was done.']",-0.848799999999997

Bush, whose popularity sank as a result of his administration’s handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in 2005. ', 'President Donald Trump, after receiving a briefing Thursday at FEMA headquarters, said the agency and local authorities had done a “fantastic job” and he plans over the weekend to visit Texas, Louisiana and perhaps another state affected by the storm. “We got a little bit lucky,” he said. “It was very big. It was very powerful. But it passed quickly.” ', 'FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the agency can handle the hurricane even as he acknowledged the challenge posed by multiple crises. ', '“I think even in a normal hurricane season, a traditional hurricane season, it’s complicated enough,” Gaynor said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Thursday. “Responding to a hurricane in a COVID-19 environment makes it a little bit more complicated. But we’ve been working on this for a while, since May.” ', 'Members of Congress have expressed concern for months about FEMA’s ability to deal with multiple disasters with leadership vacancies and strains on its budget. Reaves said there are also hundreds of rank-and-file jobs that need to be filled as well as fewer people available to deploy because of the coronavirus.', 'Those concerns grew after Trump issued an executive order to partially extend COVID-19 jobless benefits with $44 billion from the FEMA federal disaster fund after his administration failed to reach a deal with Congress to extend the benefits.', '“The fact that President Trump would take up to $44 billion from FEMA’s disaster relief fund right before a possibly record-setting hurricane season shows his inability to protect our country during a crisis,” said Rep. Donald Payne, a New Jersey Democrat. ', 'FEMA, in a written response to questions about the fund, said the executive order includes a provision that ensures the disaster fund won’t drop below $25 billion.', 'Acting Associate Administrator David Bibo said FEMA has what it needs to help affected communities through the “long and challenging road” to recovery from the storm.', '“FEMA has sufficient resources to handle the ongoing response to Hurricane Laura as well as delivering other assistance that has been authorized and directed by the president,” Bibo told reporters. “We don’t have any limiting factors at this point.” ', 'The concern about leadership vacancies isn’t new under a president who has said he prefers “acting” officials who can be easily removed and there are many throughout the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA.', 'A FEMA report on 2017 noted that staff shortages hindered the agency’s response to the series of storms that included hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. It has made efforts to address the issue, but its training academy was forced to shut down for months this year because of COVID-19.', 'Reaves, the president of Local 4060 of the American Federation of Government Employees, said there are hundreds of open jobs, including for the people whose duties include evaluating damage from hurricanes and approving contracts for recovery. He cited the slow-process of conducting background checks and competition from private companies seeking to lure away FEMA workers, among other factors.

Tarps over roofs. More tarps over shredded sides of homes — all remnants of a freak inland hurricane that blew through on Aug. 10, 2020, tore down half the city's trees and damaged 90 percent of its homes. It was a brutal storm that was especially damaging to mobile home parks such as Kirkwood Estates, where Schmadeke lived and where, seven months later, she was the last person who had not given up on getting help Washington officials vowed in the days after the disaster."", '""This ordeal is wreaking havoc on my life,"" she began typing on her computer, beneath a buckling ceiling. On the floor were tubs marking the areas too soggy to step. In the bathroom, the toilet was tilting because of the rotting floor and the shower had stopped working, leaving her to clean herself up at the kitchen sink.', 'She read back what she had typed, imagining how the words would sound to the people she was sending them to at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Does that sound stupid?"" she asked. And was the correct word wreaking? Was it wrecking? ""This ordeal is causing me much mental anguish,"" she retyped.', ""This was her third attempt to get help from the country's rescue team against natural disasters, which, as extreme weather events proliferate, has also become its de facto rescue team against climate change. Amid predictions of more storms, fires and floods, one of the first things President Joe Biden did after taking office was give FEMA a bigger mandate, starting with an initiative to steer billions of dollars toward protecting against climate disasters before they strike."", 'But the reality is that even as millions of Americans will be turning to FEMA as disasters worsen, the agency has grown significantly more restrictive with the help it gives out. Iowa is one indication of this: According to FEMA data, 22,000 people applied for aid, and 19,000 received notices telling them that they were not eligible.', 'Of those 19,000, Schmadeke was among the few hundred who did not take that initial no for a final answer. And now, even though she knew that most people who appealed were turned down again, she set her mind to persuading the agency that she needed its support.', '""The damage to my home is mounting,"" she typed. ""I have mold growing, water running down the walls and my front door will barely open and shut. On top of that, my toilet is sinking into the floor.""', 'She kept typing. ""Please stop playing games with me,"" she wrote and deleted because it might sound angry. ""I feel like I have been left out to dry and am spinning in circles,"" she wrote and kept going for more than an hour.', 'She finished and reread what she had written. ""That\'s a good letter,"" she said.', 'The agency she was writing to is one of the most crucial in times of American need. It has a budget of $24 billion and has had the same mission for 42 years: ""helping people before, during and after disasters."" FEMA was created after earthquakes and hurricanes made it clear that the country needed a way to coordinate emergency responses. It has grown to become the bulwark against the United States\' worsening climate crisis, with major programs that provide temporary housing and grants to disaster survivors.', 'Independent reviews have shown that it is not an agency that succeeds in helping everyone equally. Last year, an advisory council set up by Congress found that key FEMA programs are less accessible to disadvantaged Americans, especially poor people, and that the more aid a place receives after a disaster, the more unequal it becomes as it recovers. ""Through the entire disaster cycle, communities that have been underserved stay underserved, and thereby suffer needlessly and unjustly,"" the council found.', ""The council mentioned the Individual Assistance Program, which helps homeowners without adequate insurance rebuild after federal disasters. FEMA used to approve about two-thirds of applicants. But that changed after the agency came under criticism for letting fraud slip through in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In recent years, the program's approval rates have plummeted. Six million households applied for help between 2017 and 2020, and FEMA sent rejections to 4 million of them. In 2021, FEMA has approved 13 percent of applicants, its lowest rate yet."", 'In a news release late last month, FEMA said it approved 3,084 households for more than $11.2 million in Individual Assistance grants after the derecho. It said the aid is for “basic home repairs” and temporary housing assistance, but noted FEMA is prohibited from duplicating insurance payments or aid from other programs or organizations.', '“Fortunately, most Iowa homeowners, renters, business owners and farmers have insurance coverage for severe wind damage. Private insurance has paid more than $1.6 billion in claims as of November 2020, according to state data,” the agency said in the statement.', '“What we do strive for is to provide financial assistance that can help make a home safe and secure and habitable,"" said Chris Smith, who \u200bdirects the FEMA program.', ""This was the program's directive on Aug. 10, 2020, when a massive complex of thunderclouds began to gather in South Dakota on a morning that had been forecast to be clear and sunny. The sudden windstorm raced into Iowa, gathering strength as it went. By the time it darkened the noontime skies over the eastern part of the state, it was moving faster than Hurricane Sandy or Hurricane Harvey, with winds reaching 140 mph. The derecho tore through the state's farmland, unwrapping metal silos, picking up and throwing tractors, and flattening millions of acres of drought-parched corn before growing stronger still and crashing into homes and apartments in Cedar Rapids ——including the mobile home Schmadeke had been taking meticulous care of for two decades."", 'Sixty years old now, Schmadeke had bought the trailer when she was 38, with money she saved during a short-lived job with the U.S. Postal Service. Until then, she and her daughter had been bouncing between low-rent apartments. With its two bedrooms, pineapple-stamped wallpaper and small yard where Schmadeke planted flowers, the trailer was ""life-changing,"" as Schmadeke put it. ""We moved so much, and when we moved in, it just gave us stability,"" she said. Her daughter lived there until she went to college, and after that, Schmadeke had lived a mostly solitary life.', 'When the storm rushed in, she found herself unable to stand without being knocked over. She lay gripping the couch cushions, listening to tree branches crack and bang against her roof. In a matter of minutes, her home was ruined. She remembers seeing water streaming down the walls. She remembers opening the door and seeing streets covered in torn insulation and smashed car windows.', 'The following night, Schmadeke was taken to a hospital and diagnosed with a panic attack, her heart racing as she worried over how she would fix everything. The power stayed out for days. When it came back on, she found out that Cedar Rapids had been declared a federal disaster area, making her eligible for up to $71,000 in Individual Assistance aid.', 'She applied immediately and received a response the next day. ""ASSISTANCE NOT APPROVED,"" it began. Twice more she saw the word ""ineligible,"" then realized it was because the agency\'s automated system had not found proof in public records that she owned her home. So she wrote an appeal, a choice 3 percent of FEMA applicants make.', 'After a few weeks, she got another letter. There was no explanation this time, just a check for $48, which was followed a few days later by another check, for $1,312, also without explanation. She appealed again, saying the money was not nearly enough to cover her damage, and that resulted in another check, again with no explanation, for $2,036. But the contractors had said it would cost $9,400 to fix the roof and the bathroom alone.', 'Schmadeke guessed at what FEMA wanted her to do with the money. She got the branches removed, replaced the insulation so her water pipes would not freeze, and had the trailer put back on its foundation to stop its shaking. The money would not stretch far enough to fix the bathroom, though, and it was long gone by the time she was sitting at her desk with her finished appeal letter.', 'Schmadeke had grown up in a big family in Cedar Rapids, but the family had fractured, her daughter was rarely in touch, and the last time the park management asked for an emergency contact she had written, ""Don\'t have anyone."" Mostly, she spent her time watching home improvement shows, like the one playing the next day as she got ready to go to work for a taxi company. She moved about the trailer slowly. Her diabetes was making her dizzy lately. Her knee was giving out, too, and she needed surgery.', '""We have to make sure everything is perfect for this family,"" the TV host was saying as she turned off the show, then Schmadeke was outside for the first time in days, driving past a trailer where a woman was using her nursing school loans for roof repairs, past a trailer where the storm-shattered walls were being held together with duct tape, past a trailer in which a family was living even though the home was missing an entire side, and soon she was at the small taxi dispatch office where she was looking forward to using a bright, clean bathroom.', 'In the weeks after the storm, there were so many instances of people being turned down by FEMA that J\'nae Peterman, a program director at nonprofit, Waypoint, which deals with housing emergencies, raised the issue with a FEMA liaison. ""He told me the first step is always to be denied, and then you have to appeal,"" Peterman remembered. She remembered him explaining the reason had to do with fraud and abuse, and her responding: ""These are people in crisis. They see a denial letter, they throw it away and move on.""', 'Peterman was far from the first person to point this out. In September 2020, the U.S. Government Accountability Office urged FEMA to revise its denial letters after a review found that it led people to believe that preliminary decisions are final. FEMA has not changed its process, but it has started putting out news releases encouraging applicants to appeal', 'Schmadeke’s appeal was headed to one of four processing centers in the Washington suburbs that deal with the thousands of people who contact FEMA every day.', ""Mostly, their contact comes in the form of phone calls, which can surge to more than 100,000 a day after a major disaster. But written appeals go to these centers as well, to be handled by workers who read them and, if they are persuaded that the case deserves another look call contractors and order inspections to check for fraud, then calculate new awards. The centers are an increasingly vital part of FEMA's operation."", 'But the agency is best known for how it shows up soon after a disaster, like it did in Iowa, where it set up six drive-through tent centers for people to file applications, including one in the parking lot of the baseball stadium where Schmadeke went to file her first appeal.', 'It had been five days since Schmadeke had sent in her latest appeal. On the sixth day, she found an internet shut-off notice in her mailbox and called the company. ""I\'ve never missed a payment and the one time I\'m late you\'re going to shut me off?"" she said. The representative agreed to give her a few more days, and Schmadeke put the letter next to the overdue car insurance bill and water bill, which had tripled since her toilet began leaking after the storm.', 'At the one-week mark, she was back at work and got lucky with a $108 taxi fare. Internet paid, insurance paid, water bill paid. ""That\'s something,"" she said.', 'But day after day was the same. Wake up. Clean herself at the kitchen sink. Check the FEMA site. Check the mail. Go to work. Watch a show. Then came the 26th day, when Schmadeke checked the FEMA site and saw a letter waiting for her. ""ASSISTANCE NOT APPROVED,"" it began.', 'She read it slowly, then read it over again, looking for a reason and seeing nothing except that she had received ""all eligible assistance for this type of loss.""', 'Despite everything, part of her had believed that the agency would give her more help.

65,What we learned in Texas after Hurricane Harvey,Politico,"Jul 2, 2019",https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2019/07/02/hurricane-harvey-texas-000932,"['Justin Sullivan/Getty Images', '\n', 'Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush has two fixes Washington should make before the next superstorm.', '\nBy GEORGE P. BUSH', 'The 2019 hurricane season in the Atlantic is underway and with it brings the threat of dangerous winds, storm surges and flooding to many coastal states. But hurricanes are not the only natural disasters that devastate American communities. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first federal disaster declaration in 1953 after a tornado devastated four counties in Georgia. Since then, more than 4,000 disasters have received this designation. This year, 44 federal disaster declarations have been issued for 26 states and one U.S. territory. Since June 1, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Idaho and Vermont have all received major disaster declarations. Responding to and recovering from disasters concerns everyone elected to protect and serve others. ', 'But as I discovered leading the housing assistance mission after Hurricane Harvey, even though we are a nation of innovation, the federal disaster recovery process remains outdated, cumbersome and costly.', 'Hurricane Harvey was the second-largest storm in U.S. history, and it devastated my home state of Texas. About 30 percent of Texans were directly affected, and more than 750,000 people evacuated their homes. The scale of the disaster recovery was made even worse by the fact that two other major hurricanes struck American territory within 39 days: Harvey was followed five days later by Irma hitting Florida and then Maria decimating Puerto Rico. ', 'I was in Houston mucking out homes with a group of ', ', when I got a call from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor said he was tapping me and my agency, the Texas General Land Office, to partner with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the short-term disaster housing mission. Traditionally, FEMA had sole responsibility for temporarily housing displaced residents, but the scale of this disaster was enormous. In addition to the deadly storms, wildfires burned more than half-a-million acres of California in 2017. With available federal recovery resources stretched extremely thin, this operation called for more direct oversight at the state level and we were eager to serve. For the first time in history, a state agency would partner with FEMA in carrying out a disaster housing mission. Over the next two years, my state agency and FEMA would help more than 60,000 Texans return home after the storm through assistance programs that provided both temporary housing units and repairs. ', 'As I tackled this new mission, I quickly encountered two problems that impeded the short-term recovery process.', ' that federal law limits FEMA to providing “temporary” housing under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988.', 'That definition tied our hands and prevented the use of innovative solutions. This language values short-term fixes over long-term solutions, creating an expensive and ineffective approach to distributing disaster recovery housing resources. The manufactured houses and travel trailers predominantly used by FEMA after natural disasters are extremely costly. After purchasing the unit, transportation, installation, recertification, other administrative costs, disconnection and removal, the costs per unit typically incur between $125,000 to $200,000. ', 'A plethora of alternative housing options are available now that were not on the market when the Stafford Act passed in 1988, replacing the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. Some of these innovative housing solutions were developed in Texas, where we have a history of repeat disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and floods. These options include stackable shipping containers, small modular homes and expandable “core unit” housing utilized under an initiative called RAPIDO, a temporary-to-permanent housing strategy that provides a safe, “core” home that is customizable to meet the family’s needs for about $60,000. Owners can add on to these units as needed later on. An Austin-based 3D home technology company, ICON, can print sturdy, 600- to 800-square-foot homes in less than 24 hours for $4,000. These homes can be placed quickly and left permanently for a fraction of the cost of a temporary FEMA trailer. They can also withstand subsequent hurricane or flooding events. ', 'Even though many of these innovative options are cheaper, more durable and quickly deployable, “permanent” housing is ineligible under the Stafford Act. The manufactured housing units and travel trailers traditionally utilized by FEMA sit on axles, meaning you can haul it away after use – therefore passing the “temporary” housing test. After use, FEMA refurbishes former temporary housing units in good enough condition and the General Services Administration auctions them off, but typically for a small fraction of their cost. We can agree that the current disaster recovery process is not cost-effective.', 'prevented coordination with local officials to help displaced residents. With nearly 1 million applications for FEMA assistance submitted, county judges, mayors and other local leaders asked repeatedly for information on who needed help. FEMA controlled the application process and provided my team the names of only those deemed eligible for short-term disaster housing assistance. The federal assistance application process is daunting. It requires survivors to submit the same onerous application whether they need simple financial assistance, a small business loan, or short-term housing. Further, we had no information on who was found ineligible; therefore, community leadership had no ability to explain to constituents why they were declined for help. Many were deemed ineligible due to an error that could be easily corrected, but often the applicant gave up in frustration. Without knowing who was rejected, we could not work with survivors to file an appeal or find other forms of assistance until my staff was cleared after eight weeks of federal background checks. ', 'Additionally, we were prohibited by the federal Privacy Act of 1974 from providing any “personally identifiable information” of eligible applicants to anyone outside the program. Local leaders trying to coordinate volunteer groups and potentially distribute donated resources were baffled by the unnecessary barriers to helping survivors at a time when expediency was critical. County judges and mayors from affected areas all along the Texas coast, such as Rockport/Fulton, Kingwood, Dickinson, Port Arthur and more, were calling me daily asking for help connecting those who needed help with the volunteer organizations that were showing up on the doorsteps of their county courthouses and city halls. I personally attended more than a hundred hearings, briefings, meetings and events in affected communities to relay information and answer questions, but I couldn’t provide a simple list of names and phone numbers for those needing help. During this time of crisis, federal privacy laws choked the flow of information and recovery resources to those in need and there was nothing those of us on the ground could do to fix it. ', 'There are two relatively easy steps federal leaders could take to drastically improve the short-term disaster housing mission:', '1. Congress should amend the Stafford Act to remove the word “temporary” from the requirements, therefore allowing cost-effective, permanent resources to house displaced residents.', '2. FEMA should amend the application for assistance to allow people to voluntarily make their data available shareable with their state and local government authorities.', 'The lessons Texas learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey can help all states facing natural disasters.

In the field of emergency management, it is important to put politics aside, come together, identify why disasters are getting worse, and work toward real solutions because people’s lives depend on it.

Brock is the 10th Administrator and the youngest to hold the office. While serving as Administrator, Brock coordinated the federal government’s response to over 144 presidentially declared disasters and 112 wildfires, including three of the nation’s most devastating hurricanes and five of the worst wildfires ever experienced. During this time, nearly $44 billion of disaster activity occurred under the various federal recovery programs.', 'As the FEMA Administrator, Brock led major initiatives that will have long-lasting impacts on the emergency management community. He rapidly transformed the agency’s business enterprise by implementing innovative Community Lifeline and FEMA Integration Team concepts to strengthen public-private partnerships and permanently embed full-time staff within the offices of state and tribal governments to better meet constituent needs.

The bond was passed a year after Hurricane Harvey ravaged the Houston area. ( Melissa Phillip / Houston Chronicle)', 'Harris County on Tuesday revealed a $1.4 billion shortfall in funding for flood control projects under the bond program voters approved in 2018, a massive miscalculation that threatens to cause construction delays and cost taxpayers more than expected.', 'Budget Officer David Berry told Commissioners Court that projected funding from state and federal partners, which was supposed to supplement the $2.5 billion investment by county taxpayers, has not materialized. As a result, the county has committed to doing more work than it currently can afford to do.', '“The hope after Hurricane Harvey that federal and state partners would really be focused on Harris County, where we saw the worst damage, has not altogether turned out to be true,” Berry said.', 'Berry said the county believes it can secure an additional $100 to $500 million from the state and federal governments, but that still leaves “a substantial gap.”', 'Projects in several watersheds are close to fully funded, though planned improvements in three — Halls Bayou, Greens Bayou and the San Jacinto River — have less than half the necessary dollars. Harris County Flood Control District Executive Director Russ Poppe said no projects will be delayed so long as the funding gap is closed by the end of this year.', 'The bond program currently is projected to be completed around 2028. The flood control district has spent money to design some projects in anticipation of receiving matching funds to begin construction.', 'The court on Tuesday unanimously approved a motion directing the Harris County Flood Control District to develop a plan to secure more funds by June 30. Berry offered several potential solutions, including using some toll road funds or raising the flood control district property tax rate.', 'Harris County voters ', ' the $2.5 billion bond program in August 2018. Then-County Judge Ed Emmett and flood control district leaders said by making a down payment on better flood protection, voters could expect state and federal partners to invest an additional $2 billion or so in the plan. So far, that has turned out to be only partially accurate.', 'Poppe said the shortfall dates back to early 2018, when Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act. The measure provided a collective $66 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Housing and Urban Development and FEMA to help the country recover from the previous year’s destructive storm season, which included hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.', 'Harris County and the city of Houston in 2019 received $1 billion each from HUD to repair and rebuild Harvey-damaged homes; the county received an additional $225 million from FEMA for buyouts.', 'Poppe said the county ', ' an additional $1 billion from HUD for flood control projects.', '“The logic was … the federal government can get a level of protection on that investment they just made,” Poppe said.', 'That funding flowed from Washington through the state General Land Office, however, which decided instead to ask Texas cities and counties to apply for individual grants. Poppe said his office has made $900 million in requests, which he hoped would be decided later in the spring.', 'Emmett said he made clear to voters in 2018 that matching funds were not guaranteed. He said instead of expressing frustration with flood control district leaders for appropriation decisions beyond their control, Commissioners Court should focus its effort on ensuring the existing funds are spent.', '“We said $900 million is set aside for federal matching funds,” Emmett said. “If those don’t come through, there’s no reason why the county can’t go ahead and spend it.”', 'Hidalgo told the Chronicle she agreed that Commissioners Court is ultimately responsible for the bond program and said she supported hiring Berry as budget director last year so he would tackle complex issues, “instead of just kicking the can down the road.”', '“It’s becoming clearer and clearer that additional sources of funding will be necessary,” Hidalgo said. “We are pursuing that, as well, while continuing to push our state and federal partners to do their part.”', 'Precinct 1 Commissioner Rodney Ellis said the massive investment local taxpayer money was supposed to correct historic inequities in flood protection.

Most projects already are underway. The flood control district plans to give a comprehensive update on the bond program to Commissioners Court at its March 30 meeting.', 'Since before the flood control bond passed in 2018, Commissioners Court members generally have agreed that future bonds would be necessary, since the flood control district pegs the full cost of protecting the county against 100-year storms at more than $30 billion.', 'Ellis said voters likely would reject future proposals if they feel they were tricked into supporting the first one.', '“A bond issue will never pass for this county again if we have blood on our hands,” Ellis said. “We gave those people hope; a clear expectation that we would not let chasing state and federal money dictate what we do.”', 'Precinct 3’s Tom Ramsey agreed, arguing the county must complete all 181 projects and keep its word to voters.', '“What we committed to do … what we said at those ', ', that is what we’re going to do,” Ramsey said. “If we need a Plan B, let’s talk about it.”', 'County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who took office five months after the bond passed, said the local government once again is scrambling to fix a dilemma that should have been anticipated.', 'She compared the flood bond to her predecessor’s plan to renovate the Astrodome, which she views as an unambitious, underfunded solution to a grand problem. And she implored Berry and Poppe to get to work quickly on a better plan.', '“I’m glad that Dave, you’re thinking about this strategically,” Hidalgo said. “But this is not just a budget issue.

Internal documents from the Federal Emergency Management Agency reveal that low-income survivors of hurricanes are less likely to get money to repair their homes or cover the cost of rent, compared to more affluent people. Local officials and researchers say they also see racial disparities in who gets help.', ""NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports on - reports those disparities can erode entire neighborhoods."", 'REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Driving around Port Arthur, Texas, with John Beard feels like getting a personal tour of a family reunion.', ""JOHN BEARD: Now, where that little yellow house is, my aunt lived there. That's the Jacquet family home. Willie Jacquet is my wife's mother's cousin. That was my godparents' house. And right here is where I was born and raised."", ""HERSHER: The neighborhoods he's pointing out were once the thriving core of Black Port Arthur."", ""BEARD: This used to be a happening strip through here. There were beer joints, stores, confectioneries, barbecue pits, you name it - was all there. But this area is nothing like what it used to be, I'm telling you - nothing at all."", 'HERSHER: All of Port Arthur is surrounded by water. The city is on the Gulf of Mexico, which is bad news when a hurricane happens. And the neighborhood of El Vista is in a particularly low-lying spot. This is one of the few places that Black residents could live when the city was officially segregated.', ""BEARD: Everything here got flooded - everything. And I'm going to really show you something that's going to blow your mind."", 'HERSHER: Hurricane Harvey flooded Port Arthur nearly four years ago, but in El Vista, it looks like it was yesterday. A lot of houses still have blue tarps on their roofs. Yards are overgrown. Windows are missing.', ""BEARD: See these houses, like that one right there and this other one along, they - these were inhabited before the storm. There were people in here, but those people didn't come back."", ""HERSHER: Beard's served as a Port Arthur city councilmember for more than 15 years, and he lays the blame for what happened here partly at the feet of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To show me an example, we pull up at one of the only houses left on this block."", 'BEARD: Hi. How are you doing? Ms. Payne home?', ""HERSHER: Shirley Payne raised her children in this house - and her grandchildren. When we arrive, her great-granddaughters are playing outside. During Harvey, she had four feet of water in her house. She says the only reason she was able to rebuild is because she didn't have to rely on FEMA. She had insurance. Her neighbors who left weren't so lucky."", 'SHIRLEY PAYNE: FEMA - let me tell you about FEMA.', ""HERSHER: She says she watched neighbors apply to FEMA for money to rebuild their homes, but they struggled to prove that they owned homes that had been passed down for generations. That's common in many historically segregated communities in the U.S."", ""PAYNE: A lot of people, the houses wasn't in their name."", ""HERSHER: It would take months, or even years, to iron out the paperwork. She says elderly neighbors and people with young kids couldn't wait that long for stable housing. They couldn't afford to front the cost of a hotel or an apartment, and that left a lot of people no choice but to leave."", ""PAYNE: A lot of these houses you see down the street here, that one that's still boarded up - that's the result of Harvey. It's just sad. It's just sad."", 'HERSHER: Today, about a quarter of the houses here are empty. Similar things happened to historically Black neighborhoods after Hurricane Katrina and to residents of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. This is something local officials and researchers have been sounding the alarm about for years.', 'Chauncia Willis is the co-founder of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management.', ""CHAUNCIA WILLIS: Oh, my gosh. This isn't new. This has been happening since the beginning of America's existence. America has been treating people of color and poor people terribly in disaster. They are not a priority."", 'HERSHER: That can have devastating long-term effects on entire communities. A study after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 compared Houston neighborhoods where people of color live to those where white residents live. It found that those in heavily minority neighborhoods were less likely to receive FEMA grants to repair their homes or cover the cost of rent. That led bankruptcy rates to spike by almost 40% in non-white neighborhoods.', 'WILLIS: We know there are structural inequities within the system of how FEMA does business - their programs, their policies, their funding.', ""HERSHER: FEMA argued for decades that its programs are fair because everyone is treated equally. If you don't have insurance, you can apply for money to repair your house, cover rent or replace belongings. The application requirements are the same for everyone - a level playing field, so to speak. Now, for the first time, the agency is publicly acknowledging that this approach benefits some people more than others."", ""Keith Turi is FEMA's assistant administrator for recovery."", ""KEITH TURI: Our programs have been built on providing equal treatment to survivors, but that's not necessarily equal outcome."", ""HERSHER: Systemic racism and poverty mean that many people of color and poor people don't go into disasters on a level playing field with white people or more affluent people. Internal documents obtained by NPR through our public records requests show FEMA is aware of income-based disparities and who gets help after disasters. But FEMA says it hasn't conducted similar analyses about race, in part because the agency doesn't have the data."", ""TURI: We're not currently collecting demographic data for the survivors that we serve. We do plan to add that to our collection in the near future."", 'HERSHER: FEMA would not say when it plans to begin collecting race data or whether that data will be made public. Willis says if FEMA wants to address racial disparities after disasters, it will need to go beyond studying the problem and fundamentally change its definition of what is fair.', ""WILLIS: We need to understand first who has the greatest need and who has the least access, and we're going to start from there. When you start from there, it benefits everyone."", ""HERSHER: One solution floated by experts is to limit who is eligible for FEMA assistance to make it more like SNAP benefits or Medicaid. The agency could also stop relying on disaster survivors to apply for help. Such changes would require Congress to intervene. Meanwhile, FEMA says it's asking for input from local leaders about how to make disaster aid more equitable."", 'Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.', '(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.']",-4.963000000000001

All modeling is subject to error, and First Street doesn’t directly predict premium increases. It instead assesses how much money is needed annually to pay for estimated damages over the course of a 30-year mortgage. This is consistent with how FEMA says it will calculate its new rates.', 'Those watching FEMA also say a lot can change between now and October.', 'Rossi said he has heard the rollout could be delayed, or that some of the parameters might be adjusted “so the industry can kind of grapple a little bit more with the change.”', 'Congress could still take action that affects the rollout.', '“FEMA said it’s a programmatic change and they’re allowed to do it, but if we get a reform bill passed in June and that dictates something different, then there could be a delay,"" he said.

It also will\xa0include\xa0a broader range of flooding events, such as heavy rainfall, tsunamis and coastal erosion.', ""FEMA’s existing flood zones will not factor into rate calculations, so properties outside the zones won't automatically pay lower premiums.

And recently, on August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura lashed Louisiana with 150-mile-per-hour winds, killing six people and registering as one of the most powerful storms on record to strike the United States.', ' Hurricane Sally rapidly intensified shortly before making landfall on September 16, 2020, as a slow-moving Category 2 storm with 105 mph winds, dumping 20 to 30 inches of rainfall along hard-hit communities in western Florida and coastal Alabama.', ' All in all, as of September 23, 2020, the Atlantic hurricane season has produced 23 named storms—nearly double the season’s long-term average and exhausting, for only the second time in history, the National Hurricane Center’s list of 21 names.', ' Yet the 2020 hurricane season represents uncharted territory, as storms are expected to continue making landfall in communities that are still struggling to contain COVID-19 outbreaks, maintain social distancing, and weather the historic pandemic-induced economic downturn—all amid a national reckoning with racial oppression and resource disparities in Black communities and other communities of color.', 'Despite the deadly consequences of both delaying the federal response to the pandemic at its outset and urging states to reopen their economies before it was safe to do so, President Donald Trump has boasted about the federal government’s response to COVID-19 and the nation’s preparedness for the 2020 hurricane season.', ' This is confounding and troubling given the realities that people and state and local governments are facing on the ground, including surges in new COVID-19 cases; double-digit unemployment rates; massive state and local budget cuts due to the economic recession; and the onset of an unusually active hurricane season—caused by warmer ocean temperatures that are fueled by climate change—that continues to break storm formation records.', ' In short, extreme weather disasters, which are expected to increase in severity with climate change, are likely to further compound the ongoing, historic confluence of economic and public health crises facing the United States.', 'To protect at-risk communities from additional hardship as cash-strapped state and local governments focus their resources on providing critical services during the pandemic, the federal government must invest in immediate disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts as well as commit to longer-term investments in strong, healthy, and climate change-ready communities, infrastructure, and coastal areas. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided an additional $45 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund, and although this more than doubles the amount of money available to support the president’s emergency and disaster declarations,', ' it is not nearly enough to respond to both the coronavirus crisis and extreme weather disasters. In 2019, climate and weather disasters alone caused a total of $45 billion in damages in the United States.', ' This year will see an even higher price tag. Experts have calculated that $915 billion is needed to relieve the fiscal pressures that the COVID-19 pandemic has put on states, localities, tribes, and territories', '—all during a year that is expected to be “one of the most active hurricane seasons on record,” the resource needs of which will likely strain state and local government finances further.', ' Furthermore, President Trump’s disaster relief memorandum to address unemployment insurance redirects previously appropriated funds from general disaster relief—including extreme weather, flooding, and the severe wildfires devastating the West—to provide lost wage assistance to individuals.', ' While unemployment insurance is critical to support families during the pandemic-induced recession, the memorandum redirects $44 billion in critically needed assistance from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund at precisely the worst time and potentially diverts funds from hurricane relief assistance.', 'This hurricane season heightens the need for coordinated, comprehensive disaster planning and response from states, localities, and the federal government. In order to address the impending, deadly threat of climate-fueled extreme weather amid the COVID-19 crisis, and to ensure that the nation’s most vulnerable communities have equitable resources to protect themselves and rebuild after storms, Congress must immediately take the following actions:', 'In addition, state and local governments must take the following steps to reduce the threat and cost of future extreme weather emergencies and disasters and protect vulnerable communities:', 'The Trump administration has denied the science behind both COVID-19 and climate change and, in doing so, has abdicated responsibility for the racial and class inequities that its policies have exacerbated in communities.', ' The resulting devastation could leave a long-lasting legacy, and state, local, and federal leaders must start repairing the damage now, including by taking the actions described above.', 'When Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana 15 years ago on August 29, 2005, it became one of the most deadly and costly storms in U.S. history and laid bare the deep socioeconomic divides between communities.', ' Entire neighborhoods flooded, families lost power for months, and more than 1,800 people died.* While many families left New Orleans permanently, thousands more were forced to become refugees in their own city. Neighborhoods hit hardest were largely poor, Black communities. One study found that in parts of New Orleans during and in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, the mortality rate among Black adults was two to four times higher than that among white adults.', ' Property damage was similarly leveled inequitably. Black homeowners in the city were more than three times as likely to have been flooded during Katrina as white homeowners as a result of a history of discriminatory housing practices that relegated Black communities to lower-lying ground.', ' Many of the hard-hit Black and brown communities have yet to fully recover from the disproportionate damage from Katrina and the blatantly inequitable recovery and rebuilding efforts.', 'Without adequate support from the federal government, extreme weather this year will be especially devastating for low-income Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, which have experienced the highest contraction and death rates from COVID-19 and have also been hardest hit by the economic crisis. Black and Latinx people are nearly twice as likely to die from the virus as white people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. This is due to a variety of factors influenced by systemic racism.', ' Persistent racial inequities and historical and modern trauma inflicted by the U.S. government in Indigenous communities have left American Indian and Alaskan Native populations with some of the highest risk for the disease in the country.', ' In addition, communities of color have experienced COVID-19 hospitalization rates four to six times higher than those of white Americans,', ' and their current unemployment rates are significantly higher as well. Many of these same communities are disproportionately impacted by pollution, which brings significant public health, quality of life, and economic consequences.', 'Storm preparation brings with it new dangers in states where the COVID-19 crisis is still a major threat to communities. Officials have expressed concern that due to COVID-19 and the economic recession, individuals will be more reluctant to—and have fewer resources to—evacuate from critical storm zones and coastal areas. In a study conducted by AAA of Florida and North Carolina residents, approximately 40 percent of residents in both states said that concerns about COVID-19 make them less likely to evacuate in the event of a major hurricane.', ' The pandemic-induced recession has reduced the feasibility of basic preparations for those who are struggling financially. Many of the most at-risk families will likely end up being the most affected because stormproofing homes, evacuating, or stocking up on food, water, and gas ahead of time may be too expensive or impossible. The threat of additional surges in COVID-19 cases will follow any potential breakdown of social distancing precautions as communities evacuate, gather emergency supplies, and fill shelters to capacity.', 'On the mainland United States, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina have experienced the greatest numbers of landfalling major hurricanes since 1851.', ' By historical records, these states are the most vulnerable to tropical storms. Worryingly, they are currently also among the states hardest hit by COVID-19 and are struggling to manage the outbreak.', ' In the seven-day period ending on September 14, 2020, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and North Carolina were each among the top 10 states in the country in terms of number of new cases reported. That same week marked the peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin, which, for only the second time in recorded history, contained five simultaneously active tropical cyclones. Over that same time period, Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and North Carolina all had positive test rates above the maximum level—5 percent—that the World Health Organization has recommended states to remain below before reopening.', ' Days later, Hurricane Sally made landfall in the Gulf as a Category 2 hurricane.', ' More recently, Florida and Texas reported the highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the seven-day period through September 24, 2020. And though hurricane activity in the Atlantic is currently in a lull, unusually high storm activity is expected to pick back up with two full months remaining in the season.', 'With the exception of Gov. Roy Cooper (D) in North Carolina, these hurricane-prone states have seen little leadership to control the virus and limited acceptance of climate science and its connection to extreme weather from their governments.', ' Although COVID-19 cases, death rates, and hot spots are shifting week to week, the fundamental lack of storm protections for the most hurricane-vulnerable and historically marginalized communities in this country remains worrisome and is a potential multiplier of death and destruction. To avoid needless loss of life and a decline in quality of life, Congress and state and local officials must be ready to act this hurricane season and to prepare communities for the next one.', 'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) updated extreme weather outlook for 2020, released in August, predicted an above-average season, with an 85 percent chance of 19 to 25 named storms and a likelihood that the United States will experience three to six major hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or higher.', ' This represents a sharp increase from NOAA’s original prediction, released in May 2020, of a 70 percent chance of 13 to 19 named storms.', ' The start of the unusually active 2020 hurricane season has already broken records.', ' On July 4, the Atlantic witnessed its fifth named storm, a feat that typically does not occur until August 31.', ' And the first named hurricane of the season, Hurricane Hanna, hit southern Texas in late July, causing extreme rain and flooding.', 'This year’s extremely active hurricane season is linked to the growing severity of the climate crisis,', ' predicted to increase the strength and intensity of hurricane seasons overall.', ' Research has found that between 1979 and 2017, climate change increased the likelihood of a given tropical cyclone becoming a Category 3 to 5 storm by roughly 8 percent per decade. The study also found that hurricanes are intensifying faster, as compared to historical records.', ' The past decade has seen exceptionally strong, record-setting tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and other ocean basins. Just this May, Super Cyclone Amphan broke records as the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal.', 'In a “wake-up call” for climate change’s role in intensifying storms, some scientists are calling June an archaic start date for hurricane season.', ' Experts are calling to move the start of the season into mid-May or earlier, as 2020 marks the sixth year in a row that a named storm formed in the Atlantic before June.', 'The infrastructure that communities rely on is not prepared for intensifying flooding from future storms. Scientists and experts say it is likely that climate change will intensify rainfall from hurricanes generated over the Atlantic Ocean.', ' Hurricanes also seem to be increasingly moving more slowly over land and consequently inundating communities with rainfall for longer periods.', ' Additionally, even small increases in sea level rise fueled by climate change can significantly increase flooding from storm surge', '—by far the deadliest and most destructive aspect of hurricanes.', 'Although vulnerable coastal communities in the Southeast United States face the highest risk from hurricanes, studies have shown that storms are reaching farther inland, expanding the range of states and localities that will be affected, and further resource strapped, during peak hurricane season.', 'Community infrastructure—including buildings, water, sewage systems, roads, bridges, affordable housing, hospitals, and the electric grid—is particularly vulnerable to hurricane damage.', ' The threat of more intense and devastating storm-related flooding has disproportionately negative impacts on low-income communities and communities of color. These communities often live among less climate-resilient infrastructure that is in disrepair and ill-equipped to weather climate change effects and have fewer resources to stormproof their homes and finance and manage household evacuations and recovery.', ' Furthermore, these communities typically receive far less federal funding than is needed to rebuild their homes and communities in the wake of a disaster—much less enough to build back better to withstand the next one.', ' In fact, natural disasters and the ways in which federal disaster assistance are distributed increase wealth inequality.', ' Lastly, vulnerable communities often have limited access to affordable pollution-reducing clean energy and efficient appliances to reduce energy bills.', 'Even more worrisome are the lasting public health effects and damage that compromised hazardous waste sites can have on communities. In a July report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, researchers found that 800 hazardous Superfund sites near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are at risk of flooding in the next 20 years.', ' Superfund sites are areas containing hazardous waste that has been dumped, abandoned, left exposed, or otherwise improperly managed. These areas, designated by the EPA, pose significant dangers to the millions of people who live within a few mile radius and are vulnerable to toxic waste exposure. These communities are more often home to people who are Black, Latinx, or Indigenous and who are often low income or linguistically isolated.', ' These communities’ disproportionate exposure to local air pollutants has been linked to higher COVID-19 death rates, and residents face additional health risks as nearby Superfund sites are threatened by storm surge and flooding.', 'The 15th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on August 29—nearly seven months into the coronavirus pandemic—served as a painful reminder that both natural disasters and public health emergencies strike in uneven ways, with the heaviest toll falling on Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income communities. To address the disproportionate impacts, state, local, and federal leaders must design policies and invest in communities and infrastructure in ways that intentionally and effectively address these inequalities.', 'The disproportionate impact of Hurricane Katrina on low-income Black residents stemmed largely from the combination of racial injustices and economic inequalities embedded in pre-hurricane policies and disaster preparations as well as in the treatment of vulnerable communities during the hurricane and its aftermath. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used a flawed design, outdated data, and poor-quality materials to build the levees surrounding the city’s Black and low-income communities to save money. The city government responsible for levee maintenance failed to repair many dilapidated levees, despite warnings.', ' In addition, research has shown that Black residents were less likely than white residents to have evacuated during the storm because they could not afford to do so, and the state, federal, and local governments were slow to help evacuate those in need.', ' And Black survivors of Katrina have since reported higher rates of displacement from their communities, unemployment, psychological distress, and general life disruption than white survivors.', 'New Orleans is still reckoning with these long-standing inequalities as well as the long-term and devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina on many city residents. As Dr. Beverly Wright of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice', ' shared in a video interview with the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform: “I live in New Orleans, Louisiana and I was affected by Katrina. I lost everything and so did every member of my family. I just remember how painful it was going through the fight of being able to return home. It’s probably one of the worst examples of destroying an indigenous community and watching it be overtaken by gentrification [and] [p]eople who don’t understand the culture.”', 'According to Vox, “A decade after Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans metro area still hasn’t recovered from the storm. Although the area has grown since 2006, it holds 134,000 fewer residents, more than 39,000 fewer housing units, and nearly 2,000 fewer business establishments since Katrina hit.”', 'As Hurricane Katrina and the countless major storms making landfall across the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coast in recent years have painfully revealed, low-income communities, communities of color, and people experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events.', ' Many national, state, and local disaster recovery and resilience policies fail to adequately address the ongoing vulnerabilities experienced by low-income households.', ' When extreme weather hits, families facing these conditions can be driven deeper into economic distress. Analysis shows that housing assistance after extreme weather events often favors middle-class households and homeowners.', ' Extreme weather also exacerbates the housing and homelessness crises in the United States, driving up rates of people experiencing homelessness, damaging the already limited stock of affordable housing, and causing rents to skyrocket due to sudden supply shocks.', 'In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, homeowners received aid based on the value of their homes instead of the cost of rehabilitation. Under this formula, higher-income households that owned higher-valued homes were likely to receive more aid than lower-income households who were often in greater need.', ' In addition, the storm and subsequent development decisions virtually eradicated the city’s affordable housing stock. After Katrina, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development demolished more than 3,000 units of affordable public housing despite findings that there was an urgent need for more than 30,000 affordable rental apartments in New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of the storm—and despite the congressional mandate to preserve all housing in New Orleans. To date, a majority of the damaged rental property has not been replaced.', ' Thus, post-Katrina, demand for the remaining supply of rental housing increased, and as a result, rents skyrocketed across the metropolitan area. Since Katrina, rents in New Orleans have increased by approximately 44 percent, compared with 4 percent nationally during this same period.', 'Hurricane Katrina is one among countless examples of how extreme weather both exposes and deepens racial economic disparities. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crises and their disproportionate impacts on low-income areas and communities of color, the disparate impacts of more extreme weather in these communities are likely to be heightened as communities and state, local, and federal leaders are forced to cope with high unemployment, COVID-19 infections and spread, disaster preparedness and rebuilding, and climate change all at the same time.', 'Since 1979, FEMA has been tasked with responding to disasters and spearheading recovery efforts,', ' but 2020’s dual threats of COVID-19 and climate-induced extreme weather stand to present a challenge unprecedented in the organization’s history. In response, FEMA has released its “COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance for the 2020 Hurricane Season” for state, local, and tribal officials’ to use as they prepare their response and recovery operations, as well as guidance for U.S. residents on “personal preparedness” during the pandemic.', ' In its new guidance, FEMA has called on local officials to find more shelter space, accommodate the need for social distancing, and develop a plan to shelter people with COVID-19. FEMA also calls for state and local governments to find backup sources for supplies, distribute supplies without physical contact, and prevent disaster survivors from gathering in groups—and do all that with “diminished support” from volunteers, a critical resource for states and localities. Disaster volunteers worked 3.5 million hours during the 2017 hurricane season. If an extreme weather event hits a part of the country that is under large-scale quarantine, it is likely that far fewer volunteers will be available to support disaster response.', 'FEMA has played an important role in responding to COVID-19, deploying more than 3,000 staff nationwide and running its first 50-state disaster response effort. However, the high-contact operations required during extreme weather response pose additional threats to agency staff and risk causing COVID-19 cases to spike in areas impacted by hurricanes. According to the Sierra Club, the arrival of out-of-state utility workers and FEMA staff during recovery and response operations, combined with a population made vulnerable by the storm, “could make for a petri dish of disease.”', 'In response to the financial pressures caused by COVID-19, FEMA temporarily extended the grace period for renewals of FEMA-provided flood insurance renewals from 30 days to 120 days for policies with an expiration date between February 13 and June 15.', ' But since that extension date has passed, officials are increasingly concerned about the onset of hurricane season. Without flood insurance, households will lose their first line of defense against an extreme weather disaster, since flood insurance payments are often essential for individuals and families.', 'As the 2020 hurricane season ramps up, both the federal government and state and local officials should take several immediate steps to prepare for and respond to hurricanes and other extreme weather events during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, including the actions described below.', 'To address the immediate threat of climate-induced extreme weather and the unique dangers of hurricane response during a pandemic that is disproportionately impacting communities of color and low-income communities, Congress and the federal government should take the following steps.', 'FEMA should immediately further extend the grace period for flood insurance renewals until the end of this year and consider extending it further as the updated deadline approaches, if many households are still unable to afford to renew their policies because of lost income and the economic crisis. If FEMA does not extend the grace period for flood insurance renewals, Congress should direct FEMA to do so immediately to reduce the risk of intensifying the economic hardships that households are already experiencing as a result of the pandemic in the event that an extreme weather disaster struck when they did not have an active flood insurance policy.', 'As part of economic recovery and stimulus, Congress should provide funding for several of FEMA’s most important and underfunded programs. The Center for American Progress and the Coalition for Clean Energy and Healthy Communities recommend that Congress provide $4 billion for FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program (formerly called the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program); $1 billion for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP); $500 million per year for FEMA’s Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program; and $400 million per year for FEMA’s Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning program.', ' Congress should ensure that at least half of BRIC and HMGP funding goes to tribal communities, communities of color, and economically disadvantaged communities. These investments will allow FEMA to support greater, more equitable hurricane response measures in a time of growing inequities from climate change, extreme weather, and COVID-19.', 'In addition, Congress must design future disaster aid packages to prioritize rebuilding in low-income communities and communities of color. For example, Congress can help ensure that rebuilding affordable housing is not overlooked by requiring recipients of Community Development Block Grants-Disaster Recovery assistance to direct relief dollars toward the areas of greatest unmet need. Congress should also encourage FEMA to dedicate special funding for the rehabilitation of public housing stock. After Hurricane Sandy, FEMA dedicated $3 billion toward rebuilding public housing units in New York City that has been used for to repair and floodproof more than 200 buildings.', ' Congress should also support home modifications to reduce flood risks for housing located in or near floodplains. For example, in New York City, there are 36,000 buildings, including 26,000 single- and multi-family homes that house 218,000 residents who are located within the current effective floodplain and at risk of costly flood damages.', 'In addition, Congress must reduce the burden on cities and states in order to comply with different rules and requirements tied to various federal funding streams by prioritizing the requirements of the primary funding sources and requiring secondary funding sources to align their requirements with the primary funder in the event of a contradiction. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires its funding recipients to offer low-income residents job training, jobs, and contracting opportunities tied to community development projects in their neighborhoods,', ' whereas other federal agencies limit or prohibit local hiring practices.', ' These differences can prevent state and local officials from using multiple sources of federal funding to support the same disaster rebuilding or community development project, complicating implementation. Ultimately, Congress should require federal departments and agencies to support local hiring through their grants and contracts.', 'Lastly, by creating incentives for state and local governments to rebuild infrastructure and communities in ways that can withstand future climate change and extreme weather impacts, Congress can reduce the burden on taxpayers to foot the bill for rebuilding the same structures over and over again.', ' For example, Congress should direct FEMA to create a new federal disaster deductible to help lower the public health risks and costs of future disasters and provide an incentive for states and municipalities to protect communities and taxpayers from dangerous and costly disasters before they happen. A disaster deductible would establish a predetermined threshold that states would need to meet to access disaster aid through FEMA’s Public Assistance Program. States could reduce their deductible obligation by investing in disaster risk-reduction strategies, such as those described above. The deductible would help motivate smart state and local investments in disaster resilience rather than rewarding risky development and lax land-use and building codes that drive up disaster damages and recovery costs.', 'In 2017, President Trump rescinded a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard that required federally funded infrastructure projects to be built to a higher standard to withstand extreme weather and climate change, leaving federal investments funded by taxpayers highly vulnerable to flood risks. In 2018, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2019 was signed into law, requiring the U.S. Department of Defense to assess and safeguard against flood risks, power outages, and other extreme weather damage to military installations constructed in flood prone areas.', ' Building on the NDAA, Congress should require federal agencies to plan for future flood risk as they consider using taxpayer dollars to build facilities and infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Specifically, Congress must require agencies to use the best available information, including FEMA maps, state and local flood assessments, and other relevant information to identify and protect against future flooding. Where relevant data are not available, Congress should direct agencies to assume higher flood levels throughout the project lifetime and take steps to mitigate flood damages. Congress should give agencies flexibility to use the most effective and sensible flood risk management strategies, including nature-based solutions, structural elevation, and other resilience strategies. Forward-looking actions to reduce flood risks not only save taxpayers money but also are also widely supported. According to recent polling by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 85 percent of Americans—including 80 percent of Republicans, 91 percent of Democrats, and 87 percent of independents—are in favor of requiring federally funded projects in flood-prone areas to be built to withstand future flooding.', 'According to the federal government’s own research, 60 percent of Superfund sites are at risk of the impacts of climate change and extreme weather.', ' The communities on the frontlines of Superfund and other industrial sites are overwhelmingly low income and communities of color, and these sites can create high risks for communities of color before, during, and after hurricanes and other extreme weather events. After Hurricane Laura in August 2020, a chemical plant in Lake Charles caught fire, triggering a chlorine leak and large plumes of toxic smoke and a shelter-in-place order.', 'The EPA’s Superfund Emergency Response and Removal Program helps to protect the health and safety of these communities from oil spills and risks from potential releases of toxic substances before, during, and after natural disasters and other emergencies. This program also creates jobs in remediation, removal, cleanup, and emergency response. CAP and the Coalition for Clean Energy and Healthy Communities recommend that Congress provide $840 million to the program in an economic recovery and stimulus bill. In addition, the coalition and the co-authors of the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform have called for Congress to include in the next relief or economic stimulus bill $20 billion for Superfund site cleanup to address the fact that, as the climate continues to change, more intense hurricanes and rising seas will increasingly threaten these toxic sites capable of heavily polluting nearby communities.', 'As recommended by the co-authors of the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform in their March ', ' to Congress offering recommendations for an equitable COVID-19 response and economic recovery, Congress should provide $100 million for the National Institute of Environmental Health Science’s Environmental Career Worker Training Program, which provides job and safety training for members of communities of color and economically disadvantaged communities to secure jobs in environmental restoration, construction, the handling of hazardous materials and waste, and emergency response.', ' A 2015 report assessing the program found that “an annual federal investment of $3.5 million in the ECWTP generates a $100 million return.”', ' The report also found that the program increases the earning potential of those trained, increases tax revenue, lowers workplace injury and hiring costs, and reduces crime. As Congress seeks ways to equitably expand employment, support a just economic recovery, and build back better, increasing funding for the ECWTP is an obvious choice.', 'As part of a longer-term economic recovery and stimulus plan, Congress should create a Healthy Communities and Resilient Infrastructure Fund (HCRIF) to mobilize massive new investment in pollution-free and affordable energy and transportation options; energy efficiency improvements; smart grids, energy storage, and improved electricity transmission and distribution; climate change-ready infrastructure; and flood protections. The HCRIF would be similar to the State Future Funds idea proposed by the Center for American Progress in 2015 to support clean, affordable energy and transportation options and other infrastructure to improve community health and safety,', ' as well as the Clean Infrastructure Bank proposed by the Evergreen Project and the Center for Data Progress.', 'Of the fund’s investments, 60 percent should be invested in economically disadvantaged communities, tribal communities, and communities of color. Far too often, these communities have faced systemic racism and injustice, including exposure to high levels of toxic pollution. These same communities often have the greatest need for infrastructure improvements and are the most vulnerable to emergencies and disasters, including hurricanes and other events fueled by climate change. The fund would support projects to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and local pollution through the use of clean renewable energy sources, lower energy bills through energy efficiency measures, provide sustainable transportation options that increase access to economic opportunities, and reduce flood risks and future extreme weather and other emergencies and disasters. These projects should be designed and implemented through community-driven planning that protects against community displacement.', 'The concept of creating a fund to support healthy communities and resilient infrastructure is strongly supported in Congress and across the country. For example, several Democratic members of the House and Senate have drafted legislation that would create a National Climate Bank to drive investment into building renewable energy, clean transportation, and climate-ready communities, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas, tribal communities, and communities of color.', ' In July 2019, Sens. Edward Markey (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) introduced the National Climate Bank Act,', ' and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) introduced similar legislation in the House in December 2019.', ' The CLEAN Future Act—introduced in January by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Palone, Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko, and Energy Subcommittee Chairman Bobby L. Rush—would also create a National Climate Bank if enacted.', 'In addition to the congressional actions described above, state and local governments should take the following steps to address the acute risks of extreme weather.', 'Under any circumstances, long-standing economic inequality has made evacuating out of harm’s way too costly for many families. During a pandemic-induced economic crisis that has left many people without jobs or stable income, evacuating to safety is likely to be difficult or impossible to afford for even more people. State and local governments must move quickly to help evacuate people safely to avoid needless loss of life during a time when the nation has already endured the loss of more than 200,000 people to COVID-19.', ' For example, in advance of Hurricane Laura, some state and local officials provided buses to help people heed mandatory evacuation orders and provided hotel rooms to avoid overcrowding shelters.', ' States can also access federal grant assistance for evacuation and sheltering through FEMA’s Public Assistance Program.', ' While many states have laws to execute evacuation orders, traffic control, and evacuation to shelters, few states have plans in place for comprehensive community outreach and education on evacuation programs, and few state evacuation laws require public notice requirements. A 2018 CDC report on hurricane evacuation policies concluded that “state officials need to analyze their strategies for evacuation policies so that they address the safety and well-being of the whole community.”', ' States must ensure that evacuation plans are accessible through alternative-language public education programs and include protections for at-risk populations, people with disabilities, senior citizens, and those with economic insecurity. Authorities in hurricane-prone states must develop and implement equitable evacuation policies to enhance community resiliency and protect and safeguard at-risk populations.', 'The federal government must also play a substantial role in providing evacuation support, given that state and local budgets have been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis. Over the longer term, to ensure people have the financial means to evacuate ahead of future hurricanes and other extreme weather events, state, local, and federal leaders must dismantle income and racial inequality, including by raising the minimum wage, expanding access to economic opportunities through workforce training programs; building affordable housing in or near business districts; and expanding home ownership among Black families, including by improving access to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), among other steps.', 'To be ready for future disasters, state and local governments must create disaster rebuilding plans that prioritize rebuilding quality and energy-efficient affordable housing to avoid exacerbating the affordable housing crisis; increasing economic inequalities; and forcing residents to move and leave jobs, schools, and social support systems behind.', ' State and local leaders must also invest in infrastructure that is designed to higher standards to withstand extreme weather threats, with a focus on communities that need it the most.', ' For example, after Superstorm Sandy, New York City created a comprehensive set of climate resilience design guidelines to ensure that major projects in the region are built to withstand climate change effects and extreme weather events.', ' The guidelines were most recently updated in September 2020 and outline steps to incorporate “forward-looking climate change data into the design of City facilities” and are intended to “become an integral part of the project planning process for City agencies and designers.”', ' Similarly, after Hurricane Andrew destroyed more than 125,000 homes in Florida and left roughly 250,000 people homeless in 1992, Florida state officials and the legislature adopted and implemented a statewide building code requiring sturdier construction of windows, roofs, doors, and supporting pillars to withstand hurricane-force winds.', 'By creating standards for building clean and resilient infrastructure and housing, state leaders can ensure that infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings, and housing are built to withstand long-term extreme weather and climate change disasters and that all new building follows guidelines for zero-carbon buildings and energy efficiency. State legislatures in regions at risk of further extreme weather should pass legislation that requires new or rebuilt development—and any infrastructure investments—to take into account the risks and scientific realities of future sea level rise.', 'State and local leaders should also use federal disaster rebuilding aid to invest in green infrastructure, including parks, green spaces, tree canopy expansion, and wetland restoration. Infrastructure investments should be climate smart, resilient, and aimed at reducing flood and heat risks, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, which historically have been deprived of access to natural areas as a result of redlining and discriminatory community planning.', 'State leaders should expand state investments in rental assistance and affordable housing development, increase data collection on homelessness risks, and prioritize hazard and disaster risk-reduction investments in frontline communities before and after extreme weather disasters. States and local leaders can address safety and affordability concerns by building in locations outside of flood risk zones and proximate to high-quality economic and educational opportunities as well as health services and networks critical to social cohesion and well-being. Safe and affordable housing developments should be paired with homeownership assistance efforts to target renters, who make up a substantial portion of those living in many low-income communities and communities of color.', 'Local officials can leverage federal and state funding to buy properties that have been repeatedly flooded by extreme weather disasters and restore and repurpose the land. Public and voluntary buyout programs can help residents in at-risk areas who are willing to sell and move to safer ground, so long as these programs are designed to help address affordable housing shortages.', ' These buyout programs should be coordinated and done through inclusive processes, allowing all partners to find beneficial reuses of land—such as creating recreational areas and restoring streambanks or wetlands—and ensure risk reduction benefits. County and city leaders should also support new investments in high-density affordable housing units to help multiple families participating in a buyout program from the same community who want to stay together.', 'State and local governments must take immediate action to reduce GHG emissions that are causing climate change as well as local pollutants that threaten public health and safety. For example, state and local leaders can commit to achieving a 100 percent clean energy future—a commitment that 15 states and territories have already adopted.', ' States must also develop plans to build a pollution-free, just, and equitable clean energy economy, ensuring that all communities can access affordable and pollution-free energy options.', ' State and local leaders can meet this goal by investing in public transit, electric buses, smart growth, clean renewable energy, and energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings, among other strategies, with a focus on lowering energy bills and improving air quality for economically disadvantaged communities and communities of color.', ' Lastly, state and local leaders must develop comprehensive and equitable resilience plans to build safe, healthy, and climate change-ready communities and infrastructure. These plans should prioritize strategies and investments that address historic racial and economic inequality, create jobs, and reduce climate change and other public health threats in the most vulnerable communities.', 'As the pandemic rages on and climate change fuels more intense extreme weather, the Trump administration has continued to deny the science of both at every turn. This has left low-income communities, tribal communities, and communities of color dangerously unprepared and underresourced for the historic compounding threats of a viral pandemic; a severe economic and employment contraction; and a record-breaking hurricane season. Congress must act now to support these communities—which, historically, have been left behind time and time again—in future economic stimulus and disaster response and recovery packages. State and local leaders must also do their part by directing disaster rebuilding assistance and economic stimulus funding to prepare for more extreme weather emergencies and disasters; build climate change-ready affordable housing and infrastructure; and cut GHGs and local pollution to reduce climate change and public health threats, particularly in the most vulnerable communities.', ' is a research associate for Climate and Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress.', ' is a research associate for Climate and Energy Policy at the Center.', ' is a senior fellow for Energy and Environment at the Center.', 'The authors would like to thank Dana Kochnower, Eric Wilson, Phil Ortiz, and Elyssa White from the NYC Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, as well as Emily Gee, Richard Figueroa, Chester Hawkins, Meghan Miller, Steve Bonitatibus, and Will Beaudouin of the Center for American Progress for their valuable contributions to this report.', ': This report has been updated to correctly state the number of people who died in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.']",-10.034499999999996

', '“One of the reasons why they said Houston and Harris County didn’t need any more funding, was because people in Houston could pay more in taxes,” he said.', 'Turner reiterated that Houston was under a revenue cap, which limits the amount of money the city can collect from taxes.

At other times, Trump suggested he would withhold aid to states like California because of their political leanings.', 'The Biden administration has sought to showcase a more professional approach.', '“President Biden called Gov. Abbott and said that he put all the resources of the government at his disposal, even though he didn’t win the state of Texas — which is not something the previous occupant probably would have done,” Allred said. “He didn’t blame it on the state, either, or say this was a preventable issue and that the state should have done a better job of regulating our power grid.”', 'Allred, a Democrat, said that when a tornado ', ' two years ago, he had to strategize about how to get help from the Trump administration. “I have Texas Republicans who surround my district who I knew were closer to Trump and the White House, and I asked them if [they] could try to weigh in,” he said.', 'Still, Allred and others said the biggest test for Biden will be whether the federal government continues to provide help after the deadly storm has stopped dominating headlines.

It was also the most costly hurricane season on record. The hurricanes plus wildfires in the western states pushed the federal government’s emergency response to the limit of its capacity. The management of Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Harvey demonstrates just how ill-prepared the agencies in charge of handling consecutive disasters were -- not to mention the ', ' and the inherent danger of ', ' a catastrophe.\xa0', 'Now, on top of a pandemic that has halted the world economy and has claimed more than 200,000', ' in the US, we are experiencing the most active hurricane season in recent history, as well as the most disastrous wildfires in the history of our nation. We are witnessing in real time how little the federal government has learned from past lessons about managing multiple disasters at the same time.', 'With climate chaos already impacting millions of US residents, we urgently need to revamp our state and federal agencies dealing with disaster response and disaster preparedness. We need them to be better equipped to face the challenges of climate chaos -- not just with the big costly tragedies like the West Coast wildfires but also with the smaller, less visible incidents so many people across the nation are experiencing this year.\xa0', 'Climate chaos doesn’t look like the typical Hollywood disaster flick, where calamity is unleashed over two hours with just enough time for us to develop empathy for the main characters. It is more like a lobster in a pot: When we realize it is too hot to survive it is already too late. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is woefully ill-prepared for the compounding dangers of a deadly pandemic and a particularly busy hurricane season. Hurricane response involves mass evacuations and relocation of people, an influx of emergency responders to affected areas, and crowded communal shelters -- all factors that increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 according to a recent ', '.\xa0\xa0', 'The politicization of emergency management is another thing we should all be concerned about. In the past the Trump administration used emergency funds for his non-emergency ', '. This year, history will repeat itself as farce as Trump signs an ', ' robbing disaster relief funds to boost unemployment benefits. To make things even more ridiculous, FEMA is taking a page from Trump in handling the COVID-19 crisis. Rather than a coordinated federal response, the administration left states alone to navigate management of the pandemic. That put us in a situation where states competed for scarce resources such as test kits and personal protective equipment (PPE). In Illinois, the state comptroller had to conduct a $3 milliontransaction for PPE in the parking lot of a ', '. So we are just one big disaster away from states competing for bottled water, meals, and other disaster response needs that would translate into unnecessary suffering and even avoidable loss of lives.', 'FEMA’s ', ' offers little beyond its guidance for typical circumstances. Much like the rest of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus, this FEMA plan primarily relies on local authorities to develop emergency plans while failing to outline where the resources for virus response in a disaster (such as PPE, or socially distanced public shelters) will come from. The plan points to the ', ' to stay at least six feet from people outside of their household while in public disaster shelters, advice that can hardly be followed in overcrowded shelters that are few and far between.\xa0', 'FEMA’s guidance fails to address issues that have already arisen in previous years. For example, the new guidance recommends support for “remote inspection processes” and “remote preliminary damage assessments,” which imply victims of disaster need to contact the agency by electronic means. This ignores the fact that following Hurricane Maria ', ' of Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million inhabitants had no electricity, phone, or internet services. Why are we still relying on a plan that has been proven impossible or useless in the past?', 'At the heart of the dangers of this hurricane season is the outsized threat to low-income communities across the US, and to Black and Brown communities who have been subjected to chronic underresourcing, redlining and other forms of housing discrimination, state-sponsored police violence, and more than their fair share of pollution. The pandemic has laid bare the grave inequities in our social systems -- from health care to housing -- as Black Americans are dying from COVID-19 at ', '. Moreover, communities of color and low-income communities are on the frontlines of climate change as they have been geographically sequestered in high-risk disaster areas.\xa0', 'Moreover, the unequal distribution of emergency resources was also in stark relief in Puerto Rico in 2017, when following the devastation of hurricanes Harvey and Maria, federal agencies provided millions of dollars to areas that were heavily populated by Trump’s voter base, while the president ', ' at Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico. Now, in an election year, aid is even more likely to be driven by political decisions -- especially in Puerto Rico and other communities of color where residents have been historically underrepresented or outright excluded from the electoral process.\xa0', 'We need to update our disaster response and emergency preparedness to reflect the reality of climate change. We have rapidly changed the way we respond to disasters in the past. It took just months for the US government to establish the Department of Homeland Security in response to the September 11 terrorist attack. Even if we transition tomorrow to a fossil fuel-free economy, we won’t stop the climate-driven cycle of disasters. And communities historically burdened by environmental justice will continue to be first and worst impacted. The longer heat waves, the sudden floods, the frequent wildfires, and every-year-earlier hurricane season should be a wake-up call for our representatives in Washington, DC, to save lives and protect the economy by acting on climate now.', ""Pedro Cruz is the Acting Director of Sierra Club's\xa0Healthy Communities campaign."", 'By ', ' ', 'Feb 27 - Mar 5, 2022', '77% complete', 'Help protect wildlife and wild places, ensure clean air and water for all, and fight for environmental justice.', '*Providing your email OR phone number allows us to follow up at a later time to ask for your help in preserving our precious wildlife.', 'By clicking Remind Me, you will also receive periodic communications from the Sierra Club.

97,2019-2020 State Legislative Report on Natural Disasters,National Conference of State Legislatures,"Jan 19, 2021",https://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=35851,"['As natural disasters increase in frequency and intensity, communities across the country have sought state policy solutions. Disaster seasons of the last few years have broken records across the board.\xa0 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and 14 others made 2017 the costliest hurricane season on record. It would also have been the most destructive wildfire season on record, if not for 2018, the nation’s deadliest and most destructive year ever, featuring the deadliest single fire in a century―the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. The mega-fires of 2020 are still fresh in the nation’s mind―a year that gave California five of its six largest fires in state history, Colorado its single largest fire ever, and temporarily propelled air pollution in some cities to among the worst in the world. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation averaged nearly 12 “billion-dollar” disasters annually over the past decade―up from less than five per year between 1980 and 2009. Total damages over the past five years exceeded $525 billion—an annual average of around $106 billion.', 'Since 2017, Congress and the Trump administration have placed an increased emphasis on the state and local role in disaster management. In the fall of 2018, Congress enacted the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA)—widely considered the most comprehensive disaster reform bill since Hurricane Katrina. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has long held that disasters are “locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported,” in that order, putting state and local governments ahead of the federal response. This emphasis has strengthened in recent years, evident in such publications as FEMA’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, the National Mitigation Investment Strategy, and in general agency messaging. The agency is currently implementing a DRRA-mandated shift in the Per Capita Impact Indicator, which would raise the damage threshold by which extreme weather events are granted a presidential disaster declaration, making it more difficult for disaster-impacted states to access federal assistance under the Stafford Act.', 'While disasters worsen and the federal government eyes a reduced role, state legislatures across the country are enacting a range of disaster management solutions. In 2019 and 2020, states enacted over 200 bills relating to natural disasters. At least 70 of these bills improve infrastructure resilience, from roads and bridges to the energy grid, building codes and emergency communications. At least 100 bills enact broad emergency management reform from administrative changes to intergovernmental coordination and transparency. Despite the ongoing challenge of balancing competing priorities for limited funding within state budgets—made no simpler by historic pandemic-induced budget shortfalls—over two-thirds of states enacted at least 95 bills appropriating funds or creating financial incentives for resilience activities. This report discusses state legislative trends in broad emergency management reform, finance and appropriations, and infrastructure.', 'Jurisdiction for emergency management can vary from state to state, involving multiple agencies, offices and public officials at the state level, as well as a range of counterparts on the local and federal levels. A state may have an emergency management director, public safety commissioner, state resilience officer, state hazard mitigation officer, building and fire officials, governor’s homeland security advisor and other key personnel that all have an important role to play in managing disasters. For example, in Texas, the Division of Emergency Management oversees the use of most FEMA grants while the General Land Office oversees the use of Community Development Block Grants–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) and certain subsets of FEMA funding. Especially in the wake of extreme events, states may seek to reform these emergency management systems through legislation by establishing new positions, offices or interagency working groups; requiring preparedness or mitigation plans from existing agencies; or introducing a range of regulatory and administrative changes. For example, after Hurricane Matthew, North Carolina passed legislation creating the North Carolina Office of Response and Recovery (NCORR) in 2019 that operates under the emergency management director and is the designated grantee of CDBG-DR funds.', 'In 2019 and 2020, 29 states enacted at least 100 broad emergency management reform bills. Many of these bills reform disaster management and improve state disaster preparedness plans. Other bills alter or create new emergency response authorities for state agencies, improve coordination between state and local governments in disaster response and preparedness, and create new positions. California alone passed three bills that reorganize state emergency management by creating, consolidating or defining wildfire-specific mandates for planning and disaster management agencies, including the Catastrophe Response Council (AB 111), the California Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (AB 1054) and the Natural Resources Agency (AB 38). Similar examples include:', 'The cost of disasters at all stages is shared to varying degrees by federal, state, local, private and nonprofit sectors alike. There are many sources of federal funding available for communities impacted by a disaster; however, states frequently find it necessary to pass their own economic recovery or appropriations measures. This is true especially when 1) a presidential disaster declaration is not granted, 2) a declaration is granted, to fund the requisite state match and 3) they are needed to boost funding to rainy day accounts or disaster grants programs to advance general financial preparedness ahead of a disaster.', 'In 2019 and 2020, 36 states enacted at least 95 finance and appropriations bills. There is considerable variation among disaster funding mechanisms state to state, and 2019-2020 was no exception. In addition to increased appropriations, many of these bills relate to loan and grant programs for disaster mitigation, response and recovery activities such as climate adaptation, fire suppression, flood control projects or restoration projects following earthquakes and other natural disasters. Other bills relate to federal funding for state disaster response activities and economic recovery packages following major events. Some of these bills include:', 'Infrastructure resilience legislation typically covers a range of disaster mitigation activities and preparedness planning. Critical infrastructure spans a vast array of issues―communications infrastructure, financial sector, health sector and more. While there are few sectors that natural disasters do not impact, key state legislative trends in 2019 and 2020 in particular encompassed transportation infrastructure, building codes and energy grid resilience. These specific subsets of infrastructure resilience are discussed below. States enacted at least 70 infrastructure resilience bills in these areas.', 'When disasters arrive, their impact is most immediately evident on the built environment. Public infrastructure not only sustains some of the most extensive damage from disasters, it supports the continued operation of a range of key sectors within a community. Roads, bridges and other key components transport vulnerable populations out of harm’s way―ideally before, but sometimes during and just after, the event. As noted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in 2019, damage from extreme weather events―heat waves, drought, tropical storms, high winds, storm surges and heavy downpours―is occurring more frequently and comes at significant costs to repair. As Congress has engaged in ongoing negotiations in recent years over a comprehensive infrastructure package, it has also included a transportation resiliency strategy for weather-resilient infrastructure projects along the country’s freight corridors to mitigate extreme weather impacts.', 'States have also acknowledged and grappled with this reality. In 2019 and 2020, states considered a range of such solutions, from emergency evacuation routes during floods, fires and hurricanes to highway, road and bridge infrastructure projects and preparing for various changes resiliency may necessitate. In 2019 and 2020, at least four states—California, Florida, Maine and Vermont—enacted seven pieces of legislation addressing transportation resilience. These include:', 'Building codes have been identified as a highly cost-effective strategy to reducing the impacts of disasters. The congressionally established National Institute of Building Sciences found that the regular adoption of building codes provides an $11 benefit for every $1 invested. A recent ', '\xa0found that building codes provided more than $27 billion in cumulative mitigation benefits against flood, hurricane wind and earthquake hazards from 2000 to 2016 and could help communities avoid $132 billion to $171 billion in cumulative losses through 2040. Building code vintages and adoption processes\xa0', ' in states across the country―from enforcing a statewide building code or having a largely decentralized statewide code to having a statewide minimum code but allowing local discretion for enforcement or amendments, or deferring fully to local control. Building code requirements can also be limited to communities that are most vulnerable to disasters, such as homes in flood plains, on the coasts, or exposed to the Wildlife Urban Interface or to specific building types including state buildings or schools. Up-to-date building codes can also make a state more competitive for FEMA BRIC grants, reduce resident’s insurance premiums through the NFIP Community Rating System and the Building Codes Effectiveness Grading Schedule (BCEGS) and potentially ease recovery with Post-Disaster Public Assistance funding. In 2019 and 2020, 13 states updated their codes via regulatory processes previously established by the legislature, while five states adopted new codes or updated existing codes via legislation. These include:', 'In the wake of increasingly severe disasters, policymakers and industry have sought ways to balance energy infrastructure protection with service restoration. State legislatures have actively addressed these issues―both in disaster mitigation by providing incentives for investments that harden infrastructure and in facilitating swift response and recovery actions after disasters strike. Legislative trends in energy resilience emphasize utility regulation, grid hardening and backup power. Fourteen states enacted at least 30 bills in these areas in 2019 and 2020.', 'While the energy industry has taken its own measures to improve resilience, state legislation has complemented these efforts in interstate mutual assistance, billing practices transparency, and utility disaster mitigation plans. Utility mutual assistance agreements establish a broad support network of utilities by which neighboring (including out-of-state) utilities partner in restoration work. Similarly, state legislatures in at least 24 states implemented business rapid response laws, which temporarily remove some licensing and tax requirements for out-of-state businesses and employees engaged in emergency response and restoration work. Puerto Rico enacted a law that will add transparency to how utilities bill customers during outages, while other states have considered measures that would force utilities to compensate customers whose service isn’t restored within a certain amount of time after an event.', 'The deadly 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons prompted western states like California to pass a slate of bills regulating electric utilities. California alone passed nine bills in 2019 addressing everything from fire prevention practices to utility communication requirements. Some of these bills heightened oversight of utilities’ vegetation management and disaster mitigation plans. They also expanded state oversight and communication requirements for “de-energization” events—when utilities cut off power to portions of the grid to avoid sparking a fire during periods of elevated fire risk. Some of these bills include:', 'Utah HB 66 (2020) amends cost-recovery statutes, grants the PUC authority to establish procedures related to wildfire planning, and requires utilities and electric cooperatives to submit wildfire protection plans for the commission’s approval.', 'Some of the most disaster-impacted states have sought to prevent the worst of the damage by hardening their energy grid infrastructure in recent years. These measures encourage utilities to invest in upgrades to existing infrastructure, incorporate grid-hardening measures in plans to replace infrastructure, and often provide utilities with a way to finance projects. These measures also seek to mitigate risks from certain threats, like substation flood prevention projects in coastal areas or concrete utility pole installation in regions with higher exposure to strong winds. In some cases, these projects include undergrounding electric lines in high-risk areas—whether to mitigate against hurricane-force winds that consistently knock out power or to prevent lines from sparking the next dangerous blaze in very dry regions.', 'While California and Florida passed important grid-hardening legislation in 2019, Virginia passed a variety of energy resilience measures early in 2020. Illinois and New Jersey have also seen bills in the past two years that would require certain electric lines to be placed underground, while Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey and Texas all considered bills that sought to enhance electric system resilience. Key examples include:', 'Microgrids and backup generators can keep critical loads powered and operational—whether at an emergency shelter, a health care facility or an individual home—until normal service is restored. States like California and Puerto Rico have moved to offer clarity to microgrid developers by standardizing service tariffs. States have also considered backup power requirements for certain facilities and broad planning initiatives to identify areas and facilities where backup power would be particularly beneficial. Some of these bills include:', 'Virginia SB 350 (2020) establishes the Emergency Shelters Upgrade Assistance Grant Fund administered by the Department of Emergency Management. It provides matching funds to localities to install, maintain or repair infrastructure for backup energy generation in emergency shelters.', 'Several states also considered emergency communications legislation since 2019. Many of these bills are aimed at enhancing states’ emergency communication systems and updating 911 laws. Some bills cover training for 911 operators, while others address the costs involved with emergency telephone systems. In 2019 and 2020, 16 states enacted at least 28 bills related to emergency communications and 911. Some examples of these bills include:', 'West Virginia HB 4123 (2020) requires each county emergency answering point to be constantly operated by an emergency telecommunicator. It specifies that a county commission or the West Virginia State Police should seek the advice of telephone companies and local emergency providers in order to develop an enhanced emergency telephone system.', 'At a time when disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity, damage from extreme weather events is growing far costlier than in previous decades, and the federal government is looking to limit its role and spending on disasters, states are faced with no small challenge―and they are rising to the occasion. In the context of some of the worst disaster seasons on record, states have passed legislation in the last two years prioritizing disaster resilience across the board. States have moved to assess, strengthen and fund transportation resilience improvements, emphasizing emergency evacuation routes and vulnerable or disaster-affected routes.', 'States are learning from past lessons by revising their building code standards, hardening their energy grid, encouraging backup power, and regulating utilities to facilitate disaster prevention, mitigation, response and recovery. States are reforming the very systems behind emergency management in their communities by creating new positions, offices, authorities and transparencies within state government and between levels of government. And importantly, states are paying for it. In 2019 and 2020, nearly two-thirds of states across the country allocated several billions of dollars for hurricane mitigation and recovery―from various financial incentives for mitigation activities to new grant programs to hefty state matches for access to federal assistance. State legislatures have stepped up to address these daunting challenges and will be well equipped as the landscape in disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery continues to evolve.', ""\nWe are the nation's most respected bipartisan organization providing states support, ideas, connections and a strong voice on Capitol Hill."", ' 7700 East First Place', '\n\t\t\tDenver, CO 80230', '\n\t\t\tTel: 303-364-7700 | Fax: 303-364-7800', '444 North Capitol Street, N.W., Suite 515', '\n\t\t\tWashington, D.C. 20001', '\n\t\t\tTel: 202-624-5400 | Fax: 202-737-1069']",-9.6362

Grassroots donations from fellow Americans are much smaller. The US territory still remains without power. And President Donald Trump has yet to visit. \n', '\n  Those differences are partly because of issues unique to Puerto Rico, an island that already had a weakened infrastructure, a government struggling through bankruptcy – and that had only just been hit by Hurricane Irma. \n', '\n  In addition, each hurricane posed different threats and caused different problems.

In a tweet on Monday, FEMA said that more than 10,000 federal staff were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search and rescue and recovery efforts.\n', '\n', '\n  FEMA', ' that “thousands” of federal staff, including 500 FEMA personnel, were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as of Tuesday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the federal response to Hurricane Maria on Monday as “anything but slow.” \n', '\n  On Tuesday, President Trump said that the recovery was more difficult in Puerto Rico because of its geography.\n', '\n  “It’s very tough because it’s an island,” Trump said. “In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there, you know, we’ve got A-pluses on Texas and Florida and we will also on Puerto Rico, but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it’s a big ocean.”\n', '\n  FEMA administrator Brock Long also noted Tuesday that ', 'in San Juan was operating at a limited capacity, which made moving resources into the area more difficult.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ': Trump visited Texas twice after Hurricane Harvey.
